## Analysis of attention patterns

0. Ensure that you followed the instructions in the `data` folder, to have all the attention patterns stored in `data/magpie/<language>/attention`.
1. Start `run_attention.sh <language>`, where language can be one of the following: `nl`, `de`, `sv`, `da`, `fr`, `es`, `it`.
2. Use the `visualise.ipynb` notebook to generate the figures, where figures will be stored in the `figures/<language>` folders.
