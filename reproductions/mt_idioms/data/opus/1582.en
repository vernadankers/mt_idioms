Alan: Now don't forget if you read books by Winston Churchill and others, and a book written by a diplomat, it was called "The Whispering Gallery," he goes into the fact that Churchill and those boys were rather ticked off to say the least about this new idea of democracy and that they'd have to parallel ways to run a governmental system, democratic sham for the public to believe in, while they themselves would have a parallel government running it. Read the book. I think it was written about 1925.

Just a little change Small to say the least Both a little scared
I find it unbelievable — to say the least — that such a struggle should be put up here in the European Parliament for strict measures, while in the Council of Ministers more stringent measures at home are resisted.
Our conclusion in response to this proposition, which is to say the least against nature, is to reaffirm the trade unions' position on these problems, namely that the work must be adapted to man and not man to the work.
It would be to say the least paradoxical if the single market of 1993, whose keynote is free circulation of goods and persons, should lead to the penalization of trade.

This is impressive to say the least for a new developer on the scene.
It is, of course, surprising - to say the least - that a real right-wing politician from Turkey has been able to mislead experienced politicians without bringing in any real changes or reliable guarantees on human rights, and that these experienced poUticians, without waiting for the Turkish elections, agreed to a customs union.
Our channel Mike was not put out by the views of Colleen who has her own strong beliefs, and the reactions of some of you were to say the least a surprise to him. However, it has made many of you reflect on your own response, and that can only lead to a greater understanding of yourself.
The scientists, who have dedicated themselves to that, are flabbergasted to say the least , because it simply can not be done scientifically.

The statements to the effect that peasants are un economical and we must get rid of them, such as those made by the British Minister Gummer to the British Farmers' Association recently, are deplorable to say the least and would indicate to me that the spirit of Thatcher lives on in the minds of some.

Windows has been slowly and steadily evolving from a long time now. Many previous builds such as Windows 7 received unanimous applause and appreciation from the world whereas some versions such as Windows Vista was a disappointment to say the least in the eyes of many people as it simply did not provide something new to what we already had. Microsoft developers have been diagnosing which improvements to make and what to keep from this long learning curve and when the time for Windows 8 came, they promised something special.

Elliot and E.M. Forster: 'when these actions from the authorities are allowed to pass without protest they may become precedents for future persecutions of individuals or of organisations devoted to the spreading of opinions disliked by the authorities.'
The Commission's action with regard to Ciba-Geigy is dubious and irresponsible to say the least but not particularly surprising.
‘Thus … the general — to say the least — character of the Minister's remarks … rules out without doubt any commitment in favour of France Télécom or its creditors, and a fortiori any obligation as to the result to be achieved (and hence any idea of guarantee) as well as any obligation as to the means’.

♪ to say the least What's that for?
I fully share my group chairman’s reaction to the deplorable and unacceptable behaviour of Israel in Jericho yesterday, not to mention the strange behaviour – to say the least – of US and British troops.

I therefore find — and I say this clearly in the House — that rather than being kept at a level at which an effort can be made to tackle those problems, these negotiations are in some instances spilling over to some extent, giving rise, for instance, to incidents that are to say the least improper: I am referring to the case of an ambassador who went so far as to circulate in a parliamentary chamber certain documents criticizing a Member State which had nothing — I repeat nothing — to do with the negotiations in progress.
BETTINI (V). — (IT) Mr President, I am to say the least disturbed by what you have just said.

Le Rachinel (NI). — (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is curious to say the least to find the European Commission now applying to fisheries the same methods which have already failed when applied to agriculture, and to note its reluctance to face up to the fundamental question: Why does the overcapacity exist?
Since such 'analyses' and proposals are questionable to say the least and totally contrary to the fundamental right of freedom of expression and the right to demonstrate, will the Council state its official position on this matter?

Despite all the incantations past and present, many of them no more than the woolly expression of somewhat ill-directed spirituality, no effort has been made to address the requirements for really close coordination, which is indissociable from genuine monetary union of economic policies, and we therefore find it premature to say the least to be making proposals for transferring the States' monetary policy prerogatives in the medium term.

Or is it perhaps an attempt to deprive the 'General Affai rs' Counci1

Martens (PPE). — (NL) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would invite the House to consider the following reflections.

Until we have democratically legitimised authorities for Kosovo to act as negotiating partners of the democratically legitimised Serbs, there will be no peace settlement in the region, and we shall incur a heavy burden of guilt if we keep postponing these elections for every conceivable reason, because by so doing we undermine Mr Rugova' s position, and extremist forces - whose background, by the way, is obscure, to say the least - are able to exploit the situation and make internal political capital out of the Albanians' frustration.
