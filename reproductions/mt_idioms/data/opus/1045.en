He played the harmonium (pump organ) in a band of youngsters called "J채rvel채n pikkupelimannit" (the small fiddlers from the J채rvel채 village) until he got good enough on the fiddle to join the group as a fiddler.
I'm losing over 200 quid a week and the only person who I know ain't on the fiddle is you.
He got serious on the fiddle at about 13 years of age.
