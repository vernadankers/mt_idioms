under subsection 2.1.2, Process Emissions, first paragraph, the wording is replaced as follows: ‘Relevant emissions occur during calcination and from the oxidation of organic carbon in the raw materials. During calcination in the kiln, CO2 from carbonates is released from the raw materials. Calcination CO2 is directly linked with the lime, dolime or magnesia production. On an installation level, calcination CO2 can be calculated in two ways: based on the amount of calcium and magnesium carbonate from the raw material (mainly limestone, dolomite and magnesite) converted in the process (calculation method A), or based on the amount of calcium and magnesium oxides in the products (calculation method B). The two approaches are considered to be equivalent and can be mutually used by the operator to validate the results of the respective other method’;
