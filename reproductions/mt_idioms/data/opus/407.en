Every year, begin­ning in May, long processions of vehicles loaded with everything but the kitchen sink leave the city for the summer on the road to Jurmana, a holiday resort which has not only beaches but a thousand and one oppor­tunities for sports and recreation, not to mention music festivals.
Unfortunately what we hear today is everything but the kitchen sink being thrown into what the Lisbon Strategy should be doing.
They've got this whole team here throwing everything but the kitchen sink at this case.
They throw everything but the kitchen sink at the riders and see if they get through.
