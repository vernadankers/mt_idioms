I guess I’ll keep on trucking … Maybe, we could speak more of the newer videos of the orbs in our next chat … we haven’t the Energy link to carry on now. I have to say … I come out of this session filled with Love … which is so much better than when I came in. Thank you. I LOVE YOU.
We come through, blow the hell out of everything, and those rice patty daddies keep on trucking behind those stupid water buffalo.
Motown bounce, slip and slide, back side and keep on trucking my man.
I'm gonna keep on trucking then.
