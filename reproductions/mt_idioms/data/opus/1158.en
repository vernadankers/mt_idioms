It's plain as a pikestaff you're covering for your daughter-in-law.
In view of the fact that a dealer seeking to buy 10 000 000 kg of fresh butter for the Middle East at a price of + Bfrs 77 is unable to buy butter at this price, and given that large quantities of butter are sold off at special cut rates after six months, although they have incurred high storage costs during this period, is it not as plain as a pikestaff that it must be possible to sell fresh Community butter to third countries at a fair price, naturally with a certificate of final destination, particulary as this would result in an enormous direct saving for the Community?
