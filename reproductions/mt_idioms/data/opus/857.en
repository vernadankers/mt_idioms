How far can we let the genie out of the bottle with all the dangers, risks and threats that action may bring?
My personal opinion is that our partners on the other side of the Atlantic helped to let the genie out of the bottle and afterwards tried somehow to put it back. But they did not manage.
The very people who let the genie out of the bottle are the ones now asking whether we are on the right track.
