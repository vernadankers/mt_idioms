A reanalysis of Blake's data further indicated that the temperature difference of introverts and extraverts was considerably more marked in neurotic than in 'stable' subjects (Colquhoun & Folkard, 1978). In most of these studies the Heron Personality Inventory (and not the EPI) was used which is basically a scale of 'unsociability'. Recently, however, Revelle, Humphreys, Simon & Gilliland (1980) have suggested that of the two subscales of extraversion, impulsivity and sociability, only impulsivity is related to differences in circadian rhythm characteristics. Revelle et al. concluded that high and low impulsives differ in the phase of their 'arousal' rhythm, i.e. low impulsives are more aroused in the morning and less aroused in the evening than high impulsives. Unfortunately, they failed to take neuroticism into consideration. With regard to the adjustment of circadian rhythms, it appears that the relatively small difference between extraverts and introverts in their 'normal' rhythms may reflect rather larger ones in the rate at which they adjust (Colquhoun & Folkard, 19 78). Rather less work has been done on more general measures of adjustment to a shift in the sleep/wake cycle, although the results of a few investigations suggest people scoring high an the introversion and neuroticism scale tend to show a more negative attitude to shiftwork (Nachreiner, 1975). 1.4.(c) Subjective measures of Circadian Characteristics The vast majority of studies in this area have distinguished between morning (M) and evening (E) types with the circadian rhythms of individuals rating themselves as morning types reaching a maximum, or peak, rather earlier than those of evening types (Horne & Ostberg, 1976). Although it has not received the same theoretical validation as the EPI or Heron Personality Inventory, the Horne/Ostberg questionnaire provides a useful, albeit ad hoc, classification of morning and evening types. On the Horne & Ostberg Morningness-Eveningness scale people are classified as definite, moderate or neither morning nor evening type and differences between extreme M and E types have been found in the circadian rhythms of body temperature (Patkai, 1970; Östberg, 1973; Webb & Bonnett, 1978), catecholamine Page 106
