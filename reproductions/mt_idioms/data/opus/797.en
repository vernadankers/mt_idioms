One cannot keep up with the Joneses who want the latest and best of old - world attractions and at the same time pioneer.
And trying to keep up with the Joneses leads only to heartache and many pains.
Then, too, we will not estrange our acquaintances, arousing envy, rivalry or the spirit of trying to keep up with the Joneses by word or action.
The showy display of one’s means may stumble others and trying ‘ to keep up with the Joneses ’ is not necessary. ” ​ — See 1 John 2: 15 - 17.
