All you can do is thumb your nose at it.
It delights you to thumb your nose at society, because you consider yourself above the niceties by which it operates.
Then by all means. I- - It's just upsetting when you thumb your nose at the family.
Anything for a kick. Anything to thumb your nose at authority.
