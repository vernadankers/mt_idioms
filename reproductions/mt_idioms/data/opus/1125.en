This is a slow level with lots of waiting for enemies to move where you want them. At the start, fall onto the nearest enemy as it falls and move onto the right hand poles to get the piece of gold just below them. Be sure to wait for an opening in the enemies below before dropping onto this gold piece. The grid of 12 boxes on the right is useful. If you are on this grid but below the top of it, enemies climbing the ladder just left of the grid will not drop onto the grid and chase you. You can wait near the bottom of the grid until the enemies move above the pits of brick and concrete at the bottom left, then you can fall to the floor. This will cause the enemies to fall into the pits and become trapped. Another useful trick is to wait at the top of the ladder on the far left (where you start the level). Any enemies far enough away will run over the top of the grid of boxes and drop into the trapped area on the right. To get the gold on the leftmost floor area, you need to fill the second section of floor with enemies and dig out the squares that block the enemies in the leftmost region. You may want to lose that gold (i. e. have the enemy carrying the gold enter a dug square and be destroyed there), although it is possible to get this piece of gold if you really want it. If you leave the leftmost suspended gold until last, then it is easy to escape to the top. Alternatively, if you leave the gold inside the 2 for last, you should be able to escape without much difficultly. Otherwise, the enemies trapped on the far left will cut off your escape route.

Getting the gold requires multiple digs in the right places. However, see the next paragraph. To get out, you have to get the enemy to go over the top of the 1 and fill the pit at the bottom. There are three ways to do this. The first and most sensible is to wait on the pole above the top right edge of the 1 until the enemy is almost upon you and then move to the right, digging to your right as you reach the bottom of the 1. The second way involves timing your digging for the gold (or where the gold was); moving onto the gold at the right time will cause the enemy to fall into the pit on the right of the 1. The third way is to destroy the enemy and hope he reappears over the right side of the 1.

Trap the first enemy immediately. Go up and right and hang on the ladder to the right of a short bar. As the enemy arrives, climb up quickly. As he reaches you again, go left, drop and go up the left hand ladder to the top. The enemy should head right, over the concrete, and fall. Now go down to the bottom left corner. The enemy should drop into a false brick next to the gold. Collect all gold at the top, then dig and drop to the next enemy. Stand on him, dig left and move right. The enemy will drop into the pit. Move to the right and collect more gold as you fall. Climb to the top, drop onto the trapped enemy via a false brick under a bar and collect five more nuggets. Now dig and go down the short ladder at the right of the bricks, to kill the enemy in the pit (who has more gold). He should reappear above you and fall through a false brick back into the pit. Dig three bricks between the two enemies and go down the short ladder until the enemies bunch up. Dig two more bricks to release them. Go up the ladder, over the concrete and, just before the enemies get up to the concrete, drop down to the floor and run to the bottom of the short ladder. The enemies should come down and run into the double pit on the right. Quickly run out to the right, over the enemies. Drop onto the last piece of gold, over on the right and the hidden ladders appear. Phew! P. S. Another way to trap the left hand enemy in the false brick is to get him to follow you up the leftmost ladder while you run across the top and dig to drop onto the second enemy. Timing is VERY tight. You must dig and drop before the enemy climbs over the top left and runs right. Later, climb the right hand ladders to the top, wait on the left hand bar over a false brick till the leftmost enemy starts to run towards you, then drop. Wait again till he starts to drop, then dig two bricks at the right of a short ladder, go right and drop, then run left to the bottom of a short ladder.
