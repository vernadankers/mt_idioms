Each of these constitutes a traditional area of policy concern, but with the exception of the New and Expanded Towns programme and half - hearted attempts at assisting labour mobility, successive governments have tended to fight shy of the direct management of migration and population distribution, preferring to use indirect measures affecting the location of jobs and housing.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	fight shy of	figurative	identical	DET ADP DET VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN CCONJ ADP DET NOUN ADP DET PROPN CCONJ ADJ PROPN NOUN CCONJ ADV PUNCT ADJ NOUN ADP VERB ADJ NOUN ADJ NOUN VERB VERB PART VERB ADJ ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN CCONJ NOUN NOUN VERB PART VERB ADJ NOUN VERB DET NOUN ADP NOUN CCONJ NOUN
It is cheating a bit, I fear, to think of the Basque Coast as Pyrenean, because at this end of the chain, unlike at the other, the mountains fight shy of the water and make a decisive turn to the west some miles inland, to enter Spain ; so you can see the most northerly or westerly Pyrenees easily enough from points along the coast, but you can't feel you are among them.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	fight shy of	figurative	identical	PRON VERB VERB DET NOUN PRON VERB PART VERB ADP DET PROPN PROPN ADP PROPN ADP ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP ADP DET ADJ DET NOUN VERB ADJ ADP DET NOUN CCONJ VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN DET NOUN ADV PART VERB PROPN PUNCT ADV PRON VERB VERB DET ADV ADJ CCONJ ADJ PROPN ADV ADV ADP NOUN ADP DET NOUN CCONJ PRON VERB VERB PRON VERB ADP PRON
A new constitution was adopted in September 1904 but Congregationalists fought shy of using the word ‘ church’, with the implication that local chapels were de facto parishes within a new national body, and retained their old title of ‘ Union’ : churches remained the local bodies of gathered believers.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	fight shy of	figurative	inflection	DET ADJ NOUN VERB VERB ADP PROPN NUM CCONJ PROPN VERB ADJ ADP VERB DET NOUN PUNCT NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN VERB X X NOUN ADP DET ADJ ADJ NOUN CCONJ VERB ADJ ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT NOUN VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP VERB NOUN
