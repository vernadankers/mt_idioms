One of the accusations used and levelled against er against Christianity against the, the evangelical message, against things like the, the mission of Graham and, and others is that it, it doesn't meet the needs the, the material needs of people but if you deal with the persons spiritual needs, if their sins are forgiven, those problems that are causing the material problem, it's amazing how there are dealt with as well, the best way to sober up a person, the best way to deal with a person who's an alcoholic, the best way to deal with a person who is a drug addict, the best way to deal with a person who, who commits adultery is not by telling them the wrongs of those things, it's not by trying to, to, to do, to, to, you know, to, to counsel them it's presenting the gospel allowing Jesus Christ to come into their lives and to forgive them, that will make the person sober quicker than all the counselling in the world and Paul says I brought you the most important the fundamental thing, that Christ died for our sins Paul again when he's writing to the Romans in chapter five and verse eight he says but God demonstrates his own love towards us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us so God did in Jesus Christ what we couldn't do for ourselves, so all of you have sin, so all of my sin, and he came and he died on the cross and as he was dying there was that transmit there, for he wasn't dying for his own sin buy he was dying for your sin and for mine, it was all piled on him and so when we except what Christ has done, when we come to that place and yes I believe that you died for me,	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	chapter and verse	literal	insertion-other	NUM ADP DET NOUN VERB CCONJ VERB ADP INTJ ADP PROPN ADP DET DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN ADP DET DET NOUN ADP PROPN CCONJ CCONJ NOUN VERB ADP PRON PRON VERB VERB DET NOUN DET DET NOUN NOUN ADP NOUN CCONJ ADP PRON VERB ADP DET NOUN ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN VERB VERB DET NOUN ADJ VERB VERB DET NOUN NOUN PRON ADJ ADV ADV VERB VERB ADP ADV ADV DET ADJ NOUN PART VERB PART DET NOUN DET ADJ NOUN PART VERB ADP DET NOUN NOUN DET NOUN DET ADJ NOUN PART VERB ADP DET NOUN NOUN VERB DET NOUN NOUN DET ADJ NOUN PART VERB ADP DET NOUN NOUN NOUN VERB NOUN VERB ADV ADP VERB PRON DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN PRON ADV ADP VERB PART ADP PART VERB ADP ADP PRON VERB ADP PART VERB PRON PRON VERB DET NOUN VERB PROPN PROPN PART VERB ADP ADJ NOUN CCONJ PART VERB PRON DET VERB VERB DET NOUN ADJ ADV ADP ADJ DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN CCONJ PROPN VERB PRON VERB PRON DET ADV ADJ DET ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN VERB ADP ADJ NOUN PROPN ADV ADV PRON VERB ADP DET PROPN ADP NOUN NUM CCONJ NOUN NUM PRON VERB CCONJ PROPN VERB ADJ ADJ NOUN ADP PRON ADP DET ADP PRON VERB ADV NOUN PROPN VERB ADP PRON ADV PROPN VERB ADP PROPN PROPN NOUN PRON VERB VERB ADP PRON ADV DET ADP PRON VERB NOUN ADV DET ADP ADJ NOUN CCONJ PRON VERB CCONJ PRON VERB ADP DET NOUN CCONJ ADP PRON VERB VERB ADV VERB DET NOUN ADV ADP PRON VERB VERB ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN VERB PRON VERB VERB ADP ADJ NOUN CCONJ ADP NOUN PRON VERB ADV VERB ADP PRON CCONJ ADV ADV PRON ADP NOUN PROPN VERB VERB ADV PRON VERB ADP DET NOUN CCONJ INTJ PRON VERB ADP PRON VERB ADP PRON

yeah, well let me just read you two or three verses from Exodus, chapter forty, this is what it says then the cloud covered the tent of meeting and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle and Moses was not able to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle and throughout all their journeys whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle the sons of Israel would set out, but if the cloud was not taken up then they did not set out until the day that it was taken up, for throughout all their journeys the cloud of the Lord was on the tabernacle by day and there was fire in it by night, in the sight of all the house in Israel and if you were to turn over to kings you 've got a, you 've got a similar thing there with the dedication of the temple and as Be Ben was saying the power really it's the it's the presence of God, the shine, the glory, that cloud of, and so what, what, what catches the Lord Jesus up is really the glory of God here he is, the, the riseness, the glorified Christ being called up into heaven in the, in the glory, what he's been glorified, so he withdraws his physical, physical presence from one place here on earth to present there on the throne and yet by the holy spirit to be every where now Jesus then, he didn't cease to be truly man at either his resurrection or at his ascension, he stays man, God, the God man all the way through and it's still true today he is the God man today and that's important for you and me, think of the very worse experience that you have ever had in your life, think of the very worse experience that could happen to you, with the exception of you know that of, of say total failure of some awful sin, the worse thing, maybe a loss of someone dear to you, someone very close to you, er, er, a bereavement, the most awful experience you have had well he has gone through, he has known that experience, he has, has tempted in all points like as we are he knows our frame, he remembers were dust and he has been there and it is a man who has experienced those same experiences that you and I experience day by day, year after year, it is a man who has gone that, who has walked that path, who is in heaven interceding and praying for us, we 'll stop there cos time has gone erm we 'll stop there, we won't go on otherwise I 'll get into trouble During this past month some of the questions in the New Testament, the first one we looked at you remember was that question that Jesus asked of his disciples, do you believe that I am able to do this, then we looked at a question which the disciples asked of Jesus, why could we not cast it out last week we looked at another question, are only a few people going to be saved and this morning I 'd like us it's the final one of these questions not that there aren't other questions in the New Testament and scores, scores of others but were just looking at four er throughout this month, I 'd like us to look this morning for one at, for a few minutes, at one that Jesus asked of a man who confronted him, I 'd like to read a few verses from Luke chapter eighteen, Luke chapter eighteen I 'm gon na read from verse thirty five, it's the well known account of blind Bartimaeus, Luke chapter eighteen and verse thirty five and he came about that as Jesus was approaching Jericho a certain blind
