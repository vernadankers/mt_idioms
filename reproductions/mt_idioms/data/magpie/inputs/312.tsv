GERALD RATNER 'S pay cut from £ 574,000 to £ 383,000 a year cut no ice with angry shareholders yesterday after the jewellery tycoon admitted that losses at the chain's near 2,000 shops ballooned from £ 17,700,000 to £ 30,600,000 in the six months to August.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	cut no ice	figurative	identical	PROPN PROPN PART NOUN NOUN ADP SYM NUM PART SYM NUM DET NOUN VERB DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN VERB ADP NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP NUM NOUN VERB ADP SYM NUM PART SYM NUM ADP DET NUM NOUN ADP PROPN

And what happens is that if an embryo has the single gene for being male, it happens to have a white chromosome not surprisingly, it turns on thousands of other genes that then make the embryo into a male, but, but that single gene has to be there to act as a switch and that's that gene is also present in alligators and crocodiles so the point I 'm making is it is just wrong to say that, that all these discoveries about genetics cut no ice with human evolution, because human things can not be influenced by single genes.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	cut no ice	figurative	identical	CCONJ NOUN VERB VERB ADP ADP DET NOUN VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP VERB ADJ PRON VERB PART VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADV ADV PRON VERB ADP NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN ADJ ADV VERB DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN CCONJ CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN VERB PART VERB ADV PART VERB ADP DET NOUN CCONJ DET DET NOUN VERB ADV ADJ ADP NOUN CCONJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PRON NOUN VERB VERB PRON VERB ADV ADJ PART VERB ADP ADP ADJ DET NOUN ADP NOUN VERB DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN VERB ADV VERB VERB ADP ADJ NOUN
