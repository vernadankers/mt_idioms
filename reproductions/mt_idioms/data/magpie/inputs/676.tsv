One of the officials with whom I had dealings was John Hampden, who years later was to become a colleague ; but although he did his best to be co - operative, it was the men who held the purse - strings that counted, and, going between the MOI and Faber's, I could not extract from officialdom any commitment and Eliot naturally needed certain specific undertakings regarding finance before Faber's could think of commissioning a book, which also needed the Ministry's imprimatur.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	hold the purse strings	figurative	combined-inflection	NUM ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN PRON VERB NOUN VERB PROPN PROPN NOUN NOUN ADV VERB PART VERB DET NOUN PUNCT CCONJ ADP PRON VERB ADJ ADJ PART VERB NOUN PUNCT ADJ PRON VERB DET NOUN NOUN VERB DET NOUN PUNCT NOUN ADJ VERB CCONJ VERB ADP DET PROPN CCONJ PROPN PRON VERB ADV VERB ADP NOUN DET NOUN CCONJ PROPN ADV VERB ADJ ADJ NOUN VERB NOUN ADP PROPN VERB VERB ADP VERB DET NOUN ADJ ADV VERB DET PROPN NOUN

In line with the 1992 Further and Higher Education Act, colleges will now be responsible for managing their own budgets and the Government will hold the purse strings, funding them directly through a national FE Funding Council. Once considered the Cinderella of education, further education is now being promoted as the fairy godmother with the ability to improve post-16 education and training, stem the drop - out and failure rates and make Britain economically competitive once more.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	hold the purse strings	figurative	identical	ADP NOUN ADP DET NUM PROPN CCONJ PROPN PROPN PROPN NOUN VERB ADV VERB ADJ ADP VERB ADJ ADJ NOUN CCONJ DET PROPN VERB VERB DET NOUN NOUN VERB PRON ADV ADP DET ADJ PROPN PROPN PROPN ADV VERB DET PROPN ADP NOUN ADJ NOUN VERB ADV VERB VERB ADP DET NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN PART VERB PROPN NOUN CCONJ NOUN VERB DET NOUN PUNCT NOUN CCONJ NOUN NOUN CCONJ VERB PROPN ADV ADJ ADV ADV
This has major implications for the relationship between the two ; few local ' voluntaries ' can afford to offend those who hold purse strings and the nature of the services which they offer may sometimes be on the basis of a contract from the statutory sector ( for example, for meals - on - wheels ) rather than an independent initiative.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	hold the purse strings	figurative	deletion-determiner	DET VERB ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NUM PUNCT ADJ ADJ PUNCT NOUN PUNCT VERB VERB PART VERB DET NOUN VERB NOUN NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADJ PRON VERB VERB ADV VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADP NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT ADP PUNCT NOUN PUNCT ADV ADP DET ADJ NOUN
In its 40th year as a type, on the 10th anniversary of its only active service and the year before the 40th anniversary of the RAF, the aircraft is increasingly viewed by those who hold the purse strings as an anachronism — a symbol of a past which has no relevance in the new future.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	hold the purse strings	figurative	identical	ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ ADJ ADJ NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET PROPN DET NOUN VERB ADV VERB ADP DET NOUN VERB DET NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADJ VERB DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN
