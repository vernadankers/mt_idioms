The heterogeneity of French solo song at the beginning of the century is shown by the six books of Airs de différents autheurs published by the lutenist Gabriel Bataille ( 1575–1630 ) during 1609–15 ; each book consists partly of his own compositions, partly of airs de cour and psalm - settings by Pierre Guedron ( d. 1621 ), Le Jeune's successor as Compositeur de la chambre du Roi, Guedron's son - in - law Antoine Boesset ( 1586–1643 ), the elderly Mauduit, and others.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	by the book	literal	combined-inflection	DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN VERB VERB ADP DET NUM NOUN ADP PROPN X NOUN NOUN VERB ADP DET ADJ PROPN PROPN PUNCT NUM PUNCT ADP NUM PUNCT DET NOUN VERB ADV ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN ADV ADP NOUN X VERB CCONJ NOUN PUNCT NOUN ADP PROPN PROPN PUNCT NOUN NUM PUNCT PROPN PROPN NOUN ADP PROPN ADP DET NOUN PROPN PROPN PROPN NOUN PUNCT ADP PUNCT NOUN PROPN PROPN PUNCT NUM PUNCT DET ADJ PROPN CCONJ NOUN

Not only did the existence of a divided society help fuel party tensions under William and Anne, but taking the longer perspective covered by this book as a whole, it might even be fair to suggest that the emergence of the party divide amongst the political elite was itself a symptom of the bitter divisions that already existed in this society, divisions which we have traced back to the Restoration in 1660.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	by the book	literal	determiner-narrow	ADV ADV VERB DET NOUN ADP DET VERB NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN ADP PROPN CCONJ PROPN CCONJ VERB DET ADJ NOUN VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN PRON VERB ADV VERB ADJ PART VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN VERB PRON DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADJ ADV VERB ADP DET NOUN NOUN ADJ PRON VERB VERB ADV ADP DET PROPN ADP NUM
