Since this is a fun, letting - your - hair - down sort of show, there is also a trampoline, a rocking horse, a model, pedal - powered and car battery - operated train as well as rides on Muffin the Mule for which you need only a 5p token that can be purchased, by the bucketful downstairs.	0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	let your hair down	figurative	combined-inflection	ADP DET VERB DET NOUN VERB PUNCT ADJ PUNCT NOUN PUNCT PART ADV ADP NOUN ADV VERB ADV DET NOUN DET VERB NOUN DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT ADJ CCONJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT VERB NOUN ADV ADV ADP NOUN ADP PROPN DET PROPN ADP ADJ PRON VERB ADV DET NOUN NOUN ADJ VERB VERB VERB ADP DET ADJ ADV

It didn't seem to me the way to behave towards someone with whom you had shared a good many midnight hours, swopping confidences and generally letting your hair down, not to mention the many other evenings when we had had such fun with Henry and Jimmy, and I felt rather aggrieved at being treated this way.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	let your hair down	figurative	inflection	PRON VERB VERB ADP PRON DET NOUN PART VERB ADP NOUN ADP NOUN PRON VERB VERB DET ADJ ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB NOUN CCONJ ADV VERB ADJ NOUN PART ADV PART VERB DET ADJ ADJ NOUN ADV PRON VERB VERB ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN CCONJ PROPN CCONJ PRON VERB ADV ADJ ADP VERB VERB DET NOUN
