That is something which would have been unthinkable only a few years ago, but which is necessary today and wiU cost a huge amount, the cost of the Community bodies' foUy to say the least.
Mr Jarzembowski's point, which is well taken, that it is essential that the fees levied do not result in the distortion of competition between ports, because their rivalry is, to say the least, very interesting.

Ruari McCallion tries to firm things up a little.The UK's Referendum vote to leave the EU was unexpected, to say the least, and generated quite a lot of uncertainty, which is something that business generally hates.
Everything we experience in life is made up of an apparently indefinite number of 'nows' and, to say the least, it is remarkable that the building blocks that lead us from birth to death are slippery.

on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. - Madam President, I would also pay tribute to Mme Lulling, who has been tenacious to say the least in promoting and bringing this issue to the floor of the Parliament.

Mr Alavanos (COM). — (GR) The last reply given by the President-in-Office of the Foreign Ministers meeting in Political Cooperation is, to say the least, regrettable, and I hope he is not speaking for all the Ministers.
While at first look the provided search engine and homepage might seem quite useful you must know that they are in fact useless and will only make browsing the web a bothersome task, to say the least.
However, if, after the committee has decided on an issue, you insert a suggestion that the matter should have been handled in a different way, this seems to me, to say the least, rather unclear, legally speaking.
I would have you know that the public take a critical view of this, to say the least, and I would simply ask that we should not allow ourselves such blunders, at least within the European framework.
It would, to say the least, be prudent not to stake every thing on the adoption of fast reactors and to "hedge" with an alternative device the development of which would not call for an unduly heavy outlay.
c) The section dealing with the share-out of costs saved through wage negotiations should be dropped (German text: page 56, paragraph 2, last two sentences) since this statement is, to say the least, misleading if not analytically incorrect.
But I ask you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, how often are people criticized for not revealing in their applications that they are heterosexual ? It is strange, to say the least, that that is evidently considered unimportant.
The thinking of the President-in-Office of the Council that it is particularly important for Europe to display unity because of certain problems created by Washington through the sale of arms to Iran is curious to say the least.

On that basis, if France's argument that Groupe Brandt's borrowing capacity should be measured against that of Cevital is accepted, it is surprising to say the least that no private investor felt inclined to lend to Groupe Brandt.
In the table of statistics, mentioned by Mr Fantuzzi and annexed to price package for which I was the rapporteur, we voted, at the last part-session, for a state of affairs that is worrying to say the least.
The reason why the European Community is some what unpopular, to say the least, in the UK is that the British public, above all, want the Community to work and are disappointed because it does not do so.
In this connection, it is, to Parliament's ear, illogical, to say the least, for Spain's People's Party to denounce international interference in their country's internal affairs while proposing a resolution outrightly and unequivocally condemning the vote in the Cortes.

Ingrid : «It’s fantastic because you don’t really get that feeling of vertigo, even though you’re almost 300 metres above the ground! I would definitely recommend it to everyone, even if the start is impressive to say the least... »

I do not believe, however, that the Commission, or indeed other institutions, should have to rely on individual motivation by officials or by Commissioners and on rather ad hoc means of applying principles, which are, to say the least, rather generalised.
CARNITI (S). — (IT) Mr President, Madam Com missioner, ladies and gentlemen, two years on from the date of the launch of the social charter the progress report on its state of implementation is, to say the least of it, disappointing.

Since the government' s macroeconomic results are mediocre to say the least, the Commission, the IMF, and the World Bank have already frozen their support for structural adjustment, and the backers participating in the agrarian reform have suspended their institutional cooperation plans.

This was often said despisingly and was all part of a strategy they called ” amasu ka Moya ” i.e. ” the plans of the Spirit.” Many times I noticed that these plans of the Spirit were devious, to say the least.
on behalf of the ITS Group. - (DE) Madam President, the citizens' interest in the EU is still modest, to say the least, and this is due, among other things, to its intransparent structures, incomprehensible decisions, and a lack of media interest.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have always maintained, both in committee and in Parliament, that the Commission’s haste in pushing through its proposal – to the extent of breaking institutional and Community rules – was suspicious to say the least.
I wish to join with my colleague, Mr Sieglerschmidt, in deploring the manner in which so much of such importance is thrown at the Members of this House in a voting procedure that in fact is confusing, to say the least of it.

It is not just that healthcare financing is precarious, to say the least: doctors and nursing staff are being forced to spend more and more time shackled to their desks, dealing with red tape, instead of performing their actual task of healthcare delivery.
Upon closer examination, the paintings turn out to be apt and poignant observations of characters and types with whom the artist has shared the sheets –briefly or not – or still does. The artist is rather mystifying about this, to say the least.
I am not trying to pronounce sentence here, Mr Sieglerschmidt, but surely we ought to have said that as a Parliament we have sinned by a certain lack of elegance, to say the least. We should have stated this and have not done so.
But I think that the honourable Member will understand — and I make no criticism of past Commissions in this respect — that after five weeks it would be ill-judged of me, to say the least, to enter upon a definitive direction of policy.

I am speaking here on behalf of the Irish Members of my group and I wish to say that if this Oral Question by Mr Poettering and others was ambiguous to say the least, the com­promise resolution winding up the debate is certainly not.
The analysis provided in the report is alarming, to say the least, because at present, contrary to the Commission's statements, it seems highly unlikely that we will stick to the timetable set out six years ago and meet the priority environmental targets in 2012.

Garosci (PPE). — (lT)Mr President, those who have been speaking in this Chamber for five years now should no longer feel emotional, but the thought that today is almost the last day of this parliamentary term does move me a little, to say the least.
Face painter James Kuhn has created a 3-monkey painting that really is out of the ordinary, to say the least. Click here for the photos and further down on that page is a video clip where you can also see these three monkeys in motion.
Anyone who talks about the ruination of the social and technical infrastructure, and about the lack of food and medicines whilst leaving the regime's responsibility out of consideration, passing over it or keeping quiet about it, is behaving naively or irresponsibly, to say the least.
Let us consider one of many: the institution of the family, which is, to say the least, distorted by this report; a family model which proposes the free union between men or women of the same sex and liberalised single-parent or, precisely, homosexual, adoption laws.
It is, to say the least, worrying that the Swedish head of the EU' s Court of Auditors should choose to adapt to the worst aspects of the EU administration' s culture, namely secrecy and the desire for revenge upon employees who choose to speak out.
The history of artificial or fake grass is to say the least an interesting one and arose out of the social desire to in-effect ward off what could be seen, as far back as the 1950s, as an increasingly unhealthy tendency by youngsters not to exercise.
I am afraid that it produced very little in the way of concrete results since, even if the questions raised were justified, specifically ‘do one or more European models exist in a globalised world?’, the response given to this question lacks clarity, to say the least.
If a tree was to try to convey all the above attributes or properties of man to the rest of the trees, the task would not be easy, to say the least, and we have not yet even mentioned the soul or the spirit of man!
CUNHA DE OLIVEIRA (S), Draftsman of an opinion for the Committee on Regional Policy. — (PT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the importance of tourism and the role it is now playing and can continue to play in regional development is evident, to say the least.
Nevertheless, in keeping with the principle of the half­empty glass, I too am pleased that the final text emerging from these lengthy negotiations refers to the environment and to Annex ΠΙ on the priority projects, even though its legal status remains questionable, to say the least.
The CIA's motto is "You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free." That is hard to swallow to say the least.The Fatimids and the Assassins seem to have made deals at the upper echelon of their society with many of their supposed enemies.
The ECHO case and the dubious manner, to say the least, in which it has been dealt with by the Commission, particularly in its relations with Parliament, have guided us to this inevitable conclusion and we therefore welcome the proposal to turn UCLAF into an independent body.
Mr Ryan. — Mr President, most Members of Parliament are weary of the unprovoked and totally false abuse which Messrs Ian Paisley and John David Taylor hurl at the Government and people or Ireland. In Mr Paisley's case, it is, to say the least, bizarre that a
When I read the commitment which the Copenhagen Declaration entails, I am, to say the least, surprised that in the summary on the first page the Commission writes that at both national and Community level we have implemented a policy which corresponds to the commitment in the Copenhagen Declaration.
It is odd, to say the least, that none of those who are currently manning the barricades against these possible -and well-justified - derogations take the trouble to find out how it will be ascertained whether a Community voter has in fact voted more than once in an election.
Since we are aware that two other members of the Security Council, namely the People' s Republic of China and the Russian Federation, are currently supplying arms to Iraq, it is, in my view, irresponsible to say the least, to think that we can take decisions in this context.
The young man's right, but still not enough. Entry fees exorbitant, to say the least, skyrocketing insurance premiums, essential services paid a high price – but without batting an eyelid – by competitors who already know they have to sacrifice – or not arrive in Dakar – their off-road.
But before commenting in further detail on this report, I would like to share with you the recent developments which have occurred with regard to the Fifth Framework Programme, which is currently under discussion within the European Parliament and the Council. This inspires divided opinions, to say the least.
However, in disputes concerning the Staff Regulations, it seems that the Court of First Instance has not demonstrated the same rigour in finding, on an issue characterised to say the least by predominant judicial opinion, that the loss of an opportunity of being recruited or promoted is capable of
It is surprising, to say the least, that shortly after returning from the European summit in Luxembourg, where the leaders of the 12 Member States had agreed to coordinate their foreign policy more closely, President Mitterand of France received the Polish leader, General Jaruzelski, at the Elysée without prior consultation.
The Community's special vocation for maritime trade and the latter's importance for the strength of our economy undoubtedly plead in favour of enhancing maritime security worldwide and within the EU in particular, in the face of a security situation which is uncertain, to say the least, with regard to terrorist.
They are responsible for administering some 80% of the EU's budget and they must recognise that they are, at the very least, partners if not prime movers in attempting to address this important issue, and the report indicates that the performance of Member States has been mixed to say the least.
Clearly, we must achieve implementation of the Treaty by creating a climate of trust among our peoples. But it is premature to say the least, to call from now for institutional changes before enlargement takes place and when we have not yet observed the practical consequences of the Maastricht Treaty's implementation.
It is for this reason, which is contrary to the spirit of balance that must preside over the construction of Europe, that I cannot vote in favour of it. since to do so would be to give my blessing to a repon which, to say the least, is lacking in solidarity.
Really, this explanation seems rather childish, to say the least: justifications that are not acceptable in that there is a complete breach - as has also been mentioned already - of Article 8 of Directive 95/46/EC, and the Commission's role above all is to enforce the directives and hence Community law.
The fact is that the Commission has acted – to say the least – shamelessly and unacceptably in making these concessions in the EU-US Wine Agreement, and that I say, as a Member for one of the oldest vine-growing regions in Germany, also on behalf of the vine-growers of the Moselle.
2007-11-13 22:16:19 - The keltoi The CIA's motto is "You shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free."That is hard to swallow to say the least.The Fatimids and the Assassins seem to have made deals at the upper echelon of their society with many of their supposed enemies.
If the Commission says that it presented its letter of amendment as a result of the adoption by the Council of the basic Regulation, that would be to say the least questionable, since it would seem that the presentation of the letter of amendment predates the adoption of the basic Regulation.
Throughout the 67 legislative resolutions, the vote of the Group of the European Democratic Alliance has opposed the Commission's exclusive approach, namely, market equilibrium and budget savings despite a surplus of more than ECU 4 000 million above the ceiling of the agricultural guideline. This approach is provocative to say the least.
Fortunately, essential partners such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch disassociated themselves from the final declaration, but perhaps it will be necessary to sort out the assistance that we are able to give to the NGOs, many of which, over there, have lost all sense of responsibility to say the least.
Many players have forgotten the lucrative rewards that classic slots of this nature offers as most get caught up in the newest Video Slots that are released on a regular basis but Belissimo can return a top prize of $25,000 and that is no small chunk of change to say the least!
It would have been useful, to say the least, if the Commission had explained to Parliament in greater detail, in the context of the Klinkenborg report, which was the sub ject of a long debate here, and of the second air transport memorandum, why it had not met its obligations under Directive 83/416/EEC.
It is, of course, surprising - to say the least - that a real right-wing politician from Turkey has been able to mislead experienced politicians without bringing in any real changes or reliable guarantees on human rights, and that these experienced politicians, without waiting for the Turkish elections, agreed to a customs union.
the present state of relations between the United States and Europe, which are, to say the least, very far from being a true partnership; for international relations in general, especially relations between Washington and Moscow, between Washington and the Arab world, including the moderate Arab camp, and between Washington and the non-alighed countries.
They actually did it again; after my delayed acquaintance with this band through the predecessor 'Steg For Steg', I thought it would be a hell of a job to come up with something reaching the same level (although the very first two albums also proved to be quite alright to say the least).
Le Rachinel (NI). — (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is curious to say the least to find the European Commission now applying to fisheries the same methods which have already failed when applied to agriculture, and to note its reluctance to face up to the fundamental question: Why does the overcapacity exist?
The statements to the effect that peasants are un economical and we must get rid of them, such as those made by the British Minister Gummer to the British Farmers' Association recently, are deplorable to say the least and would indicate to me that the spirit of Thatcher lives on in the minds of some.
Therefore it is, to say the least, strange that anyone should want to delete paragraph 4, as the Political Affairs Committee proposes and as Mr Blumenfeld has just proposed, when the Council has made its position clear on the political dimension of the whole problem. This is something we must not ignore, ladies and gentlemen.
But the gospels also tell us that Peter’s own faith journey is itself a bit rocky, to say the least! Peter makes a lot of faux pas, but somehow, by grace, he is always able to recover, to admit his mistakes, to take a step back, to discern God’s voice, to learn and to change.
‘Thus … the general — to say the least — character of the Minister's remarks … rules out without doubt any commitment in favour of France Télécom or its creditors, and a fortiori any obligation as to the result to be achieved (and hence any idea of guarantee) as well as any obligation as to the means’.
I have to say to Cecilia Malmström that it was disappointing, to say the least, to see in the report that a Competitiveness Council discussed back in September a note from the Commission that, it would appear, in some Member States the political commitment to full and timely implementation has unfortunately not been translated into appropriate action.
In face of this situation we must not forget either that a month ago we as the European Parliament had expressed our serious concern: the day after those elections, which were rigged, we expressed our deep concern about the consequences this could have, consequences which would, to say the least, prejudice the democratic dialogue between majority and opposition.
As the House will know, and several speakers have already said, the Kalanke judgment of the Court of Justice in October 1995 generated controversy, to say the least, throughout Europe about the legitimacy of quotas and of other forms of positive action that are aimed at increasing the number of women in particular sectors or levels of employment.
If Magnusson stops us from bringing this testimony in on Friday, we will prove it afterwards anyway and if we do that, the whole case could have to be started all over again – while by then Magnusson’s prime witness, and actually the party that he is representing, will have been revealed to be dishonest, to say the least.
It is, to say the least, an offence against the European taxpayer for the Soviet Union to have to buy agricultural products from the European Community because of its wretched ideologically-based agricultural policy and for the European Community to be neverthless taken for a ride as a result of the tactical tricks played by those who monopolize this market.
Cooperation in decommissioning nuclear power stations that are ready for scrapping, or in the disposal of nuclear waste off the Kola peninsula and in the North Sea leaves something to be desired, to say the least, and it is far from clear why Russia has so far turned a deaf ear to the demands for safe tankers in the Baltic.
This is shocking since it is the concern for the weakest members of society which shows the degree of development of that society. Now, if one considers the lack of effort made on behalf of those with mental handicaps and their parents, one can only con clude that human solidarity within our societies is lim ited, to say the least.
The next one is Amendment No 4, because the Council's wording for paragraph 1 of article 7 was confusing to say the least: there is a wide gap between the 15,000 Ecus recognized by the States which we might say are lagging behind, and the 20,000 Ecus in the advanced States -which is what we would like all to have.
Being exposed to different religions for the first time in my life, made me question which religion is really true. I wondered if there really is one God or if all the different gods are all the same God in the end, which we worship under different names and in different ways? I was very confused, to say the least!
Instead of looking ahead and trying to convince the Greek population of the need to give an identity to the Macedonian population, both Albanian and Slav-Macedonian, through the name 'Macedonia' , they have blocked, with insolence to say the least, any process which would enable Macedonians to finally have a republic which is not called FYROM, Madam President-in-Office, but 'Macedonia' .
The result of the Drug Rundown is freedom from the harmful effects of drugs, alcohol and medicine and freedom from the need to take them. A person's perceptions and recordings of the physical universe when on drugs are inaccurate, to say the least, as they are a combination of past events, imagination and the actual events which occurred at the time.
Given also the long and sometimes tumultuous political arguments which have raged over the deployment of missiles in the Member States of the Community and which are still a matter of fierce debate in my own country, the Netherlands, I find it surprising, to say the least, that the smaller States of the Community will be unrepresented at the meeting in New York.
"During the year, we opened an office in North America, launched the EC233 – our most powerful tiltrotator thus far, aimed at excavators up to 33 metric tons – and invested millions in our Strömsund factory. An aggressive year, to say the least," comments Blomgren, who predicts Engcon will probably enjoy annual sales of one billion kronor in time for the next financial statement.
The stylistic unity of most of the English Suites definitely causes confusion in setting their precise date, not to say the least, in many of the French dances (and in the French Suites and the Partitas for harpsichord, also known as the German Suites) the typical repeated note at the beginning of nearly every piece and certain regularly reappearing harmonic links in some suites.
We unanimously agreed that it was strange, to say the least, that we were being asked our opinion on the building of housing that was part of an integrated operation, as we are not entitled to give our opinion on such operations because, ultimately, they do not involve very stringent criteria as regards the choice of site, the timetabling or the supervision of coordination.
Mr Schinzel. — (DE) Is it not true to say that it puts the European Community in a very dubious light, to say the least, if, faced with the fact that no moves towards democracy have been made in Turkey and that torture, terror and murder continue to be official political weapons, the Council of Ministers nevertheless merely expresses its concern but otherwise does nothing?
First of all, to publish a tender for something which has not received the approval of the Council strikes me as being extraordinary to say the least; and secondly, to encourage an organization which is clearly involved in the public health sector to apply for a tender which is about the social economy also seems to me to be perhaps well-meaning but nonetheless gross mismanagement.
And it is true that while we are perfectly aware of the difficulties faced by Turkey as a result of the presence of Islamic fundamentalist elements on their territory, which are a danger, which require certain measures to be taken, at the same time we must accept that, in terms of democratic principles, the journey they have to make is still, to say the least, very long.
So it is strange that in its relations with the Community, Canada should establish surpluses that are problematical to say the least - and which no doubt will not arise, on account of the situation denounced by the Scientific Council - in return for what amounts to the complete subordination of the Community to the dictates of Canada in the managing organs of the North-West Atlantic Fisheries Organization.
In some western mystical traditions this transcendent state is sometimes referenced by the enigmatic phrase I Am That I Am. In normal waking states of consciousness, in which the subject (you) and the object are clearly perceived as distinctly different, this statement seems odd to say the least. However, in states of mystical contemplation it is self-apparent and accurately describes the sense of Self that arises in non-duality.
Russia's situation remains very critical to say the least in the areas of democracy, respect for human rights, the freedom of press and freedom of association, the situation in Chechnya - which may no longer be headline news, but anyone who closely follows that country knows that the situation in Chechnya is still very critical - and also in terms of the problems involved in the preparations for the Winter Olympics in Sochi.
Commissioner, just like you, we want to stick to the procedure ensuring that this entire process is conducted correctly, and we await the final opinion of the Venice Commission, although it is now clear from the preliminary conclusions presented in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs by the Secretary of the Venice Commission, Mr Markert, that the current Hungarian constitution is, in a number of points, controversial to say the least.
Alan: Now don't forget if you read books by Winston Churchill and others, and a book written by a diplomat, it was called "The Whispering Gallery," he goes into the fact that Churchill and those boys were rather ticked off to say the least about this new idea of democracy and that they'd have to parallel ways to run a governmental system, democratic sham for the public to believe in, while they themselves would have a parallel government running it.
What is the reason for this scandal? The reason is that our production is continuously growing because of the increased use of animal feedstuffs com­posed of substitute products imported at low prices, and although we had the 'courage' — and I put this word between inverted commas — to limit our imports of these products from the developing countries, we did not have the same resolve, to say the least, in limit- · ing similar imports from the United States.
‘The microeconomic method of the event study used by the economic consultant raises a number of fundamental issues, including the use of the very short-term trend in the share price as the sole measure of changes in the value of the company contrary to recognised usage (including by the Community courts regarding valuation, and this despite the fact that the manifest errors committed recently by the markets in assessing the value of telecommunications operators call for, to say the least, serious caution.
In this respect, I should like to say to President Santer - who, I should add, has both my respect and my sympathy - that when he states in Parliament that positive advances have been achieved in respect of the five employment priorities agreed upon at Essen, and then restated at all the subsequent Council meetings, he should also recall that at the same time, sadly, unemployment has also advanced. This should suggest, to say the least, doubts as to whether the treatment envisaged
The view that politics is the art of the possible, that is the art of compromise, may well be acceptable in relation to the democratic dialectic but it assumes a negative implication when used to camouflage what are to say the least inappropriate political interests, short-term national egotism and the basic intention to avoid intervening — to opt therefore for the speculative and the expedient, that is to say inaction in the face of crucial and high-risk issues which bring into play individual and political popularity.
Alan: Now don't forget if you read books by Winston Churchill and others, and a book written by a diplomat, it was called "The Whispering Gallery," he goes into the fact that Churchill and those boys were rather ticked off to say the least about this new idea of democracy and that they'd have to parallel ways to run a governmental system, democratic sham for the public to believe in, while they themselves would have a parallel government running it. Read the book. I think it was written about 1925.
This word clearly does not mean a struggle with sin only in the soul, to say the least. Next, a qitalist fights in God’s cause or way, and two results ensue: either he lives to fight another day so that maybe he can be martyred, or he dies in battle and securely goes to Islamic heaven, completing the ultimate good work. Finally, in a religious system (Islam) that requires an unspecified quantity of good works, today’s jihadists and qitalists have a strong psychological pull on their troubled minds to kill themselves in martyrdom.
For the Commission to entrust ARTM, an international association under Belgian law, with the financial management of the MED projects without any legal basis and without obtaining the opinion of the legal service or of financial control, for the management board members also to be managers of the technical assistance agencies and to be involved in awarding some project funds without tenders and thereby secure themselves a large slice of the cake, that is to say fat contracts, is to say the least an overlapping of interests, as is also the view of the Court of Auditors and UCLAF.
We should remember that the Commission, despite various alarm signals and questions - I recall one by Mr Muscardini from 1994 - was unwilling or unable to provide detailed information on the market in bone-meals, at the very time when those meals were being identified as the pathogenic agent of BSE; it was unwilling or unable to relate the information and warnings coming from the European press, among other sources, to the possible connections between the disease affecting cattle and the transmissibility of that disease to man; its handling of relations with the British political and health authorities was suspect to say the least, perhaps even; it proved excessively vulnerable to pressure exerted by the manufacturers of bone-meals and companies operating in the beef and veal industry.
