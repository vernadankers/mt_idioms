nomenclature Every substance in the Carbonchemistry has a main name, based on the number of C-atoms in the main chain: Met..., et..., prop..., but..., pent..., hex..., hept..., oct..., non..., dec..., in general: alk... on the dots appear suffixes: ane: the main chain has only single bonds. ene: the main chain has also double bonds. yne: the main chain has also triple bonds. yl: in this case we deal with a branch, not with a main chain.
Now it turns out that this same European Community, which insisted that we enter without a burden of the past, presents us on 31st December 1985, on the dot of 1986, when Spain became a member, with a burden of 20 000 million ECUs; we do not know how it will be financed and it will go on increasing year after year if a clear policy on agriculture is not adopted to prevent the stockpiles and, consequently, the financial requirements growing every year.

So in general, if you're trying to find the work for a constant displacement, and you have a constant force, you just take the dot product of those two vectors. And if the dot product is a completely foreign concept to you, might want to watch, I think I've made multiple, 4 or 5 videos on the dot product, and its intuition, and how it compares. But just to give you a little bit of that intuition right here, the dot product, when I take f dot d, or d dot f, what it's giving me is, I'm multiplying the magnitude, well
