(ii) Amylolytic enzymes break down starch and its derivatives. These enzymes are obtained from bacteria, and are used in brewing to hydrolyse the starch in the raw barley, in baking and pastry to modify the consistency of the dough, and in the manufacture of fruit juices intended for concentration to eliminate cloudiness caused by starch.
A number of articles and the annex should, accordingly, be removed for reasons of legal clarity and transparency. This is due to the scrapping of premium and production control schemes, and to the transfer of the content of certain articles and the annex to detailed rules on implementation and adoption in the raw tobacco sector.
In these fast-changing times we are witnessing the gradual disappearance of traditional employment and massive cuts in jobs in the raw materials and industrial fields while it is fore cast that many of those employed today will have to retrain before the end of the century, we must devote particular attention to the category of self-employed.

The Commission should come up with a more precise description here especially as it is difficult to make all-inclusive statements given the diversity of the various sub-sectors (26 industry sectors in five groups according to NACE 27) and the different structures (in the raw materials industry the majority are large businesses and in processing there are many SMEs).
This Regulation refers to Regulations replaced by Commission Regulation (EC) No 2848/98 of 22 December 1998 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2075/92 as regards the premium scheme, production quotas and the specific aid to be granted to producer groups in the raw tobacco sector(4), as last amended by Regulation (EC) No 2162/1999(5).
If you examine export movements to the European Community of timber from Sarawak at the present time, you may easily see that, in contrast to what happens with the large-scale Asian importers, what comes to the European Community is timber already processed in Sarawak itself, whereas in fact timber is exported to the Asian countries in the raw state.
It was replaced in 1992 by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2075/92 [5] and substantially amended in 1998 by Council Regulation (EC) No 1636/98 [6] and Commission Regulation (EC) No 2848/98 [7].The CMO in the raw tobacco sector provides for (i) a production quota system and (ii) support of producers’ income through a premium system for the production of raw tobacco.
