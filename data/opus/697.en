As far as institutional reform is concerned, let me be clear: if we want the European Union to remain an unprecedented model of success, if we want, despite the handicap of numbers, to retain the means to act, if we want every citizen of Europe to recognise the Union's decisions as legitimate ones if, in a nutshell, politicians are still determined to construct Europe, then we must agree to go further in the reform of the institutions and decisionmaking procedures.

To give just one example: it says on page 11 that currently 17 million people are infected with the virus worldwide whilst on page 20 the figure is suddenly 'just' 13 million; on page 11 it is estimated that there will be some 40 million HIV-positive people by the year 2000 whilst on page 20 the forecast for that same year is suddenly between 40 and 110 million.

In a nutshell, you said that we had spent money on reducing the fishing effort, and we see that these funds have, in actual fact, served to increase it; you said that we had spent money on preserving fish stocks, and - on the basis of the figures you have disclosed, although we were not able to see them - fish stocks have become completely impoverished; you said we had spent money on limiting the social impact on this sector in terms of employment, and today you have told us that 66 thousand jobs have been lost and 28 thousand are likely to be lost in the future.
But, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen — and here I particularly address parliamentarians represent ing coastal and maritime areas of the Community — the Commission can strive, within the framework of this policy of conservation of resources, to apply greater technical precision when fixing TACs and quotas. One thing, however, is clear: if we wish to maintain conservation of the Community's resources, it is inevitable that there must be a drastic adjustment of fishing capacities to the volume of available and foreseeable resources, bearing in mind that, as Mrs Péry so rightly said yesterday — and I think that the phrase puts it in a nutshell — 'too many boats are chasing too few fish.'
Merengue is still the happiest and most danceable form of Latin American music , says Eddy Herrera ( eg known from the hit Carolina ) . This statement gives in a nutshell , what is about merengue . For indeed merengue is a very cheerful Latin American music and dance style (even though there are many sad merengue , but that aside ) and also very danceable . The merengue is from the Dominican Republic , a country on one of the Greater Antilles , the island of Hispaniola , which the Dominican Republic has to share with Haiti . On this island and exactly in the agricultural region Siboa , the merengue is created . This must be done so in the first half of the 19th century .
