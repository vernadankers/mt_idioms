It is with real concern that we also have to point the finger yet again at the Council of Ministers: while it knows full well that Member States are not fulfilling their existing undertakings, it glibly goes on producing communiqués of fine words, which advocate even further moves to liberalisation, completion of the single market, increased cross-border trade and fair competition.
I do not wish to point the finger at any of the parties, for that is also difficult with so many parties being sat around the table, but it should be said that the way in which the Commissioner has acted has unfortunately not led to the desired results, and that it is now becoming more difficult for developing countries to gain a stronger foothold in the world economy.
This is the first time that we have made statements of this kind about Member States - plural, because there are several of them in the European Union.

That, at least in my opinion, is the basic way to cure institutions which are all, without exception - and it would be laughable for Parliament now to point the finger solely at the Commission - tainted with the image of being interfering, money guzzling and unproductive institutions, and I fear to a large extent justifiably so.
If this should happen, and obviously we hope it does not, then we should have to point the finger at the parties responsible, and this would not mean Mr Duisenberg.

on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (MT) Mr President the worst thing we could do would be to point the finger at one another instead of working together to find a solution to this serious problem, a problem that, as has been said, does not simply pertain to one country, but to all countries.
Furthermore, we in this House cannot afford - and this has been said often enough already, but it needs to be said again - to point the finger of blame at all sorts of human rights abuses all over the world, drawing up resolutions and generally lamenting the situation, if at the same time we refuse to talk about the torture, rape, suppression, abuse and psychological terrorism practised by the institutions of the European Union and its Member States.
In the discharge procedure - something which started in this Chamber earlier this week when Mr Friedmann, on behalf of the Court of Auditors, presented both the Court of Auditors' annual report and the statement of assurance -we saw quite clearly that when we look at the inefficient use of resources, the areas where management procedures have been seriously lacking, the Court of Auditors has identified that 90 % of the instances of inadequate information or improper audit trails rest not with the Commission itself but with the Member States of the European Union, particularly including some of those who shout loudest and point the finger at other institutions most regularly.

I have in the past drawn the attention of the Commission to the fact that SEITA in France for example makes enormous losses, subsidized by the French tax payer, which permits SEITA to sell brands like Gauloise in other countries of the Community thereby offering unfair competition to privately owned private sector profitable tobacco manufacturers.

We know how this is done, and we are seeing it happen before our eyes.
One of the problems now, Mr President, is that you have allowed the right wing of this Parliament — and I would not want to point the finger at some of them, whom I know quite well and would not want to put into that category, but I could point the finger at some others — to make statements that are really disgusting in relation to a world statesman who was buried today.
Men and women of very different political affiliations have been murdered, and in these circumstances, while we cannot ignore the problem of human rights abuse, nor can we point the finger at the Colombian Government in its virtually unaided fight against drug trafficking - a fight in which it is setting a clear example of effective ness, as demonstrated by the elimination of the Medellin cartel.

I think Parliament often protests about this method, not to point the finger at any specific party within the Council, and I certainly would not want the Portuguese Presidency to feel responsible for this state of affairs, since, the truth is, it is something of a tradition, which the Council has kept going for a long time.
