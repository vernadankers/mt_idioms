People are blaming the British Government, some blame the Unitary Council and others point the finger at the town council but, as always, the dark hand of the European Union lies in the background, for they are all working towards the framework set out in the EU's European transport policy for 2010.
Of course, none of us means to exonerate Israel for what has been happening in Gaza in recent days - the Israeli armed forces have to accept some of the responsibility - but it would be a serious mistake to point the finger just at Israel for the crisis as a whole.
Even if the situation in Italy is extremely worrying due to a continuing conflict of interest between the ownership and/or control of the public or private media and some political powers, I share the opinion of many colleagues that the European Parliament should not point the finger at one or other Member State.
What is regrettable about this debate is that some Members – particularly in the lead committee – keep trying to point the finger of suspicion at the medical research industry, and hence also at those who deal with patents, with unwarranted insinuations that they are indifferent to people in poorer parts of the world.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (MT) Mr President the worst thing we could do would be to point the finger at one another instead of working together to find a solution to this serious problem, a problem that, as has been said, does not simply pertain to one country, but to all countries.
It is not our job here today to point the finger at people who will be found by very good police work. It is our job to make it clear to the evil people who have no respect for life and liberty that the people of this Community will see that it is made safe
I should just like to point out here, Mr President, that I have racked my brains in an effort to understand why the Committee on Budgetary Control, which is so quick to point the finger at other people's problems, has so far failed to address the problems of buildings policy, par ticularly as regards Bmssels.
I say that because, unfortunately, we have to recognise that Mr Sylla's report is full of such examples, and it is not enough for us as Members of the European Parliament to denounce violations of fundamental rights in countries outside the EU if we do not point the finger at violations in our own countries.
Nor do I wish to point the finger at anyone, as the past years were surprisingly not bad ones for the steel industry and it is difficult to think in terms of cutting or proposing to cutback capacity at a time when there is a lot of work and a lot of money is being made.
The resolution is critical of the censorship of the Internet that goes on in certain countries, and that is very much to the point, but it is another example of what happens in this House very often, in that we point the finger only at the others, without considering the situation in the European Union itself.
Once again, this does not mean, as a Member has just said, that we should point the finger at Greece. However, it is important, it is urgent - as we have been saying for some time now - to learn the necessary lessons so that we can build a more political Europe and move towards economic governance.
I think Parliament often protests about this method, not to point the finger at any specific party within the Council, and I certainly would not want the Portuguese Presidency to feel responsible for this state of affairs, since, the truth is, it is something of a tradition, which the Council has kept going for a long time.
That, at least in my opinion, is the basic way to cure institutions which are all, without exception — and it would be laughable for Parliament now to point the finger solely at the Commission — tainted with the image of being interfering, money guzzling and unproductive institutions, and I fear to a large extent justifiably so.

In particular, I call upon the European nations to reflect that we must pay the most particular attention to this phenomenon in our own countries and we must eliminate its causes and its effects if we, as Europeans attending such a conference, are to have longterm credibility when we point the finger at human rights violations outside Europe.

Mr President, it is a matter of great sorrow that we have to point the finger at one Member State - one of the founder Member States of this Union - for not fulfilling its solemn undertakings, for being prepared to act against the laws of the European Union and indeed for taking the law into its own hands.
McKenna in the United States it is clear that such an abhorrent pun ishment does not work and it is about time the Americans actually realised that they are way behind the rest of the international community and cannot point the finger at other, what I would call more primitive countries that we criticize with regard to the death penalty.
They represent, of course, only a couple of steps that Europe can take in addressing the enormous problem that corruption presents to society, but let us – the Commission, Parliament and the Member States – make them a priority, so that we no longer merely point the finger at the developing countries, but also own up to our own wrongdoing.
It is with real concern that we also have to point the finger yet again at the Council of Ministers: while it knows full well that Member States are not fulfilling their existing undertakings, it glibly goes on producing communiqués of fine words, which advocate even further moves to liberalisation, completion of the single market, increased cross-border trade and fair competition.
It is not my intention here to point the finger at the medical profession, still less at individual members of it, but to drive home the point that many human lives could be saved by simple procedures to screen for cancer of the breast, the uterus and the intestine, and by more vigorous action to raise the awareness of general practitioners.
This is the first time that we have made statements of this kind about Member States - plural, because there are several of them in the European Union. We are always keen to point the finger at other countries, but I think that if we take Europe seriously, if we are a community of values, we should put our own house in order first.
The last thing I believe we want to do in this House is to point the finger too directly at wrong-doing in any particular country — in this case Italy and more pre cisely on the island of Sicily — because there is proof that in the past, in other parts of the Community and in other countries, misappropriation of Community funds has occurred.
Men and women of very different political affiliations have been murdered, and in these circumstances, while we cannot ignore the problem of human rights abuse, nor can we point the finger at the Colombian Government in its virtually unaided fight against drug trafficking - a fight in which it is setting a clear example of effective ness, as demonstrated by the elimination of the Medellin cartel.
In view of the spiral of unparalleled and ruthless violence in recent weeks, it was certainly time for more specific language, and to point the finger of blame not only at the acts of Palestinian suicide terrorists, which we condemn, but also the provocation, destructive acts, extra judicial executions, excessive use of force and the isolationist measures used by the Sharon government in relation to the Palestinians.
This resolution does not aim so much to point the finger at the Member State in which the fatal tragedy involving Semira Adamu took place - although that Member State must of course initiate the necessary judicial enquiry and bring it to a conclusion -, as it aims to stress the need to introduce future measures in full respect of the provisions of the Geneva Convention on refugees.
In fact if you look at the rising crime figures in the United States it is clear that such an abhorrent punishment does not work and it is about time the Americans actually realised that they are way behind the rest of the international community and cannot point the finger at other, what I would call more primitive countries that we criticize with regard to the death penalty.
I do not wish to point the finger at any of the parties, for that is also difficult with so many parties being sat around the table, but it should be said that the way in which the Commissioner has acted has unfortunately not led to the desired results, and that it is now becoming more difficult for developing countries to gain a stronger foothold in the world economy.
One of the problems now, Mr President, is that you have allowed the right wing of this Parliament — and I would not want to point the finger at some of them, whom I know quite well and would not want to put into that category, but I could point the finger at some others — to make statements that are really disgusting in relation to a world statesman who was buried today.
This region is, of course, marked by criminality, hatred and conflicts, but if we do not even send two-thirds of the police officers we have promised to the area, so that a whole shift is missing in this crisis region, and on top of that there is no night shift, and all this happens simply because we are not meeting our own obligations, then we can scarcely point the finger of blame at others.
When it comes to the topic of obesity many people are quick to point the finger at various foods and food companies but the grocery manufacturers of America a Washington, D.C.-based lobby group whose mission is to advance the interests of the food, beverage, and consumer products industry are quick to shift the focus away from the companies they represent and to remind everyone that there's more at work here than just eating poorly.
Steal productive wealth from people who help raise the standard of living Use that money to regulate the disadvantaged and less productive and push them into poverty Encourage much of the population in dependency And subsequently point the finger at the outsiders from which the productive wealth has been stolen in the first place as the primary cause of the problems, to facilitate in the process the enrichment of the "evil capitalists" that are the insiders.
The Commission is always quick to point the finger at such discrimination in the laws of small countries, but as far as I am aware it has taken no action against the discriminatory provisions recently incorporated into their laws by certain large countries — I am thinking in particular of the privatization legislation in France, where as you know acquiring a shareholding of more than 5% to 10% in a foreign company is not allowed without the Government's agreement.
Furthermore, we in this House cannot afford - and this has been said often enough already, but it needs to be said again - to point the finger of blame at all sorts of human rights abuses all over the world, drawing up resolutions and generally lamenting the situation, if at the same time we refuse to talk about the torture, rape, suppression, abuse and psychological terrorism practised by the institutions of the European Union and its Member States.
It is also a fact that the economic difficulties and painful changes being experienced by various East European countries and parts of the Community are fostering a mood of instability, creating circumstances in which it becomes easy for political groups to exploit feelings of anxiety and insecurity among young people in particular, and to point the finger at scapegoats, such as immigrants, refugees and Jews. We know how this is done, and we are seeing it happen before our eyes.
But I believe that it is wrong - as has happened once again this morning - to point the finger at one part of the political spectrum, in this case the extreme right, not so much because the extreme right does not sometimes show its racist and xenophobic colours, but because I believe that this way of focusing the debate will encourage, not prevent, racism and xenophobia: the more the finger is pointed at them, the more this phenomenon will flourish underground.
I have in the past drawn the attention of the Commission to the fact that SEITA in France for example makes enormous losses, subsidized by the French tax payer, which permits SEITA to sell brands like Gauloise in other countries of the Community thereby offering unfair competition to privately owned private sector profitable tobacco manufacturers. It seems to me that if we in the Community are concerned about tobacco and cancer we should point the finger of sus picion towards the governments of some Member States.
Solely from the mobilisations will we be able to determine the uncertain future when the fascist police, who recall times past when defenceless demonstrators were shot at, and the torturers with falsified evidence will point the finger of accusation, and the mass media and the judges will sentence people (to death), and when in fact all will be free to think what we always wanted to think, while in reality we will not think and will not even express it, let alone bring it into practice.
For that reason, our responsibility is not only to use our foreign policy, security policy and development policy as a means to the end of doing away with this form of slavery; we must also be unrelenting in using all the means with which we, in Europe, combat cross-border crime and fight for our internal security, to hunt down the operators and organisers of this sort of sex tourism, for if we do not, we will have not the least right to point the finger at others.
And before my observation of this phenomenon inspires anyone to point the finger at me for being a bigoted rabble-rouser, I would point out that I haven't yet finished my story, as we will eventually benefit from this very process, which should in due course provide us with resistance against more than just our national diseases, thus enabling us when embarking on our exotic travels to skip at least some of the currently inevitable inoculations - on condition, that is, that you should personally lick any small change you receive, starting today.
In the discharge procedure - something which started in this Chamber earlier this week when Mr Friedmann, on behalf of the Court of Auditors, presented both the Court of Auditors' annual report and the statement of assurance -we saw quite clearly that when we look at the inefficient use of resources, the areas where management procedures have been seriously lacking, the Court of Auditors has identified that 90 % of the instances of inadequate information or improper audit trails rest not with the Commission itself but with the Member States of the European Union, particularly including some of those who shout loudest and point the finger at other institutions most regularly.

A general discussion was then held in which the points indicated were made by the following members: Mr Nilsson (the agricultural sector had to have the courage to take a critical look at itself, but it had to be recognised at the same time that, under the current agricultural policy framework, farmers were being urged to achieve high production levels whilst receiving the lowest possible prices; training and education were highly important factors if we were to achieve an agricultural sector which was more in tune with the environment); Mr Bento Gonçalves (it was unfair constantly to point the finger of blame at the agricultural sector; farmers were only doing what the CAP was asking them to do and other sectors were responsible for at least as much, if not more, environmental pollution), Mr Ribbe (criticism should not be directed towards individual farmers but towards the CAP as such; the existing cross-compliance mechanisms were inadequate; accompanying measures designed to promote more environmentally-friendly agricultural practices had hardly gained a foothold in areas of highly intensive agriculture where such measures were most needed); Mr Retureau (the Court of Auditor's report basically demonstrated that the CAP was funding damage to the environment and in that respect the agricultural sector very much had to admit that it had been in the wrong; we needed to have a sustainable agricultural sector and the NAT section also had to make its contribution towards the deliberations on that matter); Mr Donnelly (the importation of cheap agricultural products from outside the EU hampered the achievement of more sustainable - and consequently more expensive - production in the EU; adjustments in the agricultural sector could not be made from one day to the next); Mr Moraleda (it was unfair to heap all the blame on the agriculture sector; the demands facing farmers to ensure that their products were both cheap and produced in environmentally-friendly ways were mutually contradictory and the approach adopted to agricultural policy had to be amended accordingly); Mr Strasser (whilst the criticism set out in the report undoubtedly had to be taken seriously, it was unfair to blame only farmers - and certainly individual farmers - as the press had a habit of doing; considerable progress had certainly been made in recent years in bringing the CAP more in tune with the environment; further progress was dependent on a number of factors, including finding a solution to the problem in reconciling, on the one hand, a highly competitive world market, and the downward pressure on prices, with, on the other hand, the ever louder calls in the EU for a more sustainable agricultural sector producing higher quality products); Mr Linssen (examples from the Netherlands demonstrated that, in addition to legislation, agreements could play a useful role in helping to resolve environmental problems in the agricultural sector).
