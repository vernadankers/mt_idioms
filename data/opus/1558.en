- So we're clear... - The other night, you throw down the gauntlet to a trigger-happy U. S. Marshal, and this morning, you remember you have pressing business out of town?
The time's gonna come when I throw down the gauntlet and say, "It's me or her."
On that point I throw down the gauntlet to the Commission to take hard action in cases where there is a lack of 'fair play', in cases of market distortion.
This relationship is affecting you, our work and our friendship. The time's gonna come when I throw down the gauntlet and say, " It's me or her."
I SHALL THROW DOWN THE GAUNTLET AND GO FIRST.
