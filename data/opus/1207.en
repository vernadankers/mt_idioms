Last year you didn’t pull your punches when the Changerism think tank published a critical report about RSM’s relationship with the fossil fuels industry.
I think you should pull your punches until somebody... finds out something, and does it definitely.
Why pull your punches then if you were in the right?
Mr President of the Commission, I would make this request to you and your staff: when you draft your progress report for Romania and Bulgaria – Parliament has given its assent for both countries, but there will be this progress report – please do not pull your punches in this report, but describe the situation as it really is, openly and honestly.
Learn to pull your punches a little better.
