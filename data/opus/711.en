In light of this, Decision 2005/692/EC as amended by Commission Implementing Decision 2012/248/EU of 7 May 2012 amending Decisions 2005/692/EC, 2005/734/EC, 2007/25/EC and 2009/494/EC as regards avian influenza [4] no longer suspends imports from Thailand into the Union of the products covered by Decision 2005/692/EC including meat of poultry, farmed ratites and wild game-birds, and eggs.
In light of the discussion that took place on that occasion with the representatives of the national parliaments, the Commission, as provided for in its working programme for this year, is now finalising its communication on the democratic control of Europol, in which it will put forward a number of ideas designed to improve this process.
The TEN-E Programme's financial resources and set-up have however proven to be inadequate in light of the paradigm shift to a low carbon energy system and hence the major evolution and investments needed in energy infrastructures in the coming years (limited budget, no risk mitigation instruments, no funding outside the EU, insufficient synergies with other EU funds).
"In light of the length and disturbing descriptions of Dennis McGuire's execution, in addition to the range of lethal injection complications reported in other states, it appears that this country's lethal injection procedure is more egregious and problematic than it ever has been," Deborah Denno, from the Fordham University School of Law, told AFP in an email.
In light of the above, the Commission does not object to the possibility for tugboats to be eligible for tonnage tax, provided that at least 50 % of the operational time from the work actually carried out by the tugboat during the course of the year was generated by the provision of services which constitute maritime transport.
Lord Plumb did seem to indicate he would suggest to the enlarged Bureau that it was looked at again, particularly in light of the fact that over 100 Members of this House, despite a very sparse attendance, have already signed the resolution by Mr Newton Dunn under Rule 65 asking for the enlarged Bureau to make this change.
The EESC regards this as an opportunity to recalibrate policies in light of the experience acquired by the Member States and give a new impetus to the process of EU electricity market integration, by focusing more clearly on the benefits to the public (in particular the most vulnerable people) and the eradication of fuel poverty in the EU.
The EESC regards this as an opportunity to recalibrate policies in light of the experience acquired by the Member States and give a new impetus to the process of EU electricity market integration, by focusing more clearly on the benefits to the public (in particular the most vulnerable people) and the eradication of energy poverty in the EU.
In order to establish that an advantage is selective, the Commission has to demonstrate that a measure differentiates between economic operators who are, in light of the objective of the reference system identified, in a comparable factual and legal situation and that such a differentiation cannot be justified by the nature or the general scheme of the reference system.
In light of the withdrawal of the complaint by the Union industry and the proposed termination of the proceeding without imposition of measures, the Commission did not consider it necessary to analyse the comments received from interested parties regarding the initiation of the investigation and regarding the preliminary findings spelled out in the information document mentioned in recital (8).
In light of the above, the Commission has concluded that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 23(4) of the basic Regulation and to make imports of the product under investigation, whether declared as originating in Malaysia and Taiwan or not, subject to registration, in accordance with Article 24(5) of the basic Regulation.
Overall, the Authority therefore, in light of the legal status of Landsvirkjun, the past evident use of Landsvirkjun as a tool to attract foreign investment and the general circumstances of the case concludes that the Power Contract is imputable to the State, and that it entails State resources if and to the extent it confers an advantage on Verne.
It is in light of this objective that domain names requested by any undertaking having its registered office, central administration or principal place of business within the EU, any organisation established within the EU, without prejudice to the application of national law, and any natural person resident within the EU must be registered in the .eu Top Level Domain.
In its judgment delivered today, the Court of Justice holds that national legislation which prohibits the import, sale or use of foreign decoder cards is contrary to the freedom to provide services and cannot be justified either in light of the objective of protecting intellectual property rights or by the objective of encouraging the public to attend football stadiums.
In light of these developments and with a view to strengthening the European framework for integration ahead of the new constitutional Treaty, the Commission will consider the need for setting up a more formal basis within which exchange of information on integration could take place in the future without prejudices to the European Employment Strategy and the European Inclusion Strategy.
In accordance with paragraph 68 of the RAG 2007-13, and in light of the in-depth assessment conducted on the basis of the IDAC, the Commission concludes that the aid is necessary to provide an incentive effect for the investment and that the benefits of the aid measure outweigh the resulting distortion of competition and effect on trade between Member States.
In light of the experience gained with the supervision of the equivalence system, it is necessary to amend the content of the list of control bodies and control authorities recognised in accordance with Article 33(3) of Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 in order to ensure that information on operators under the control of those control bodies and control authorities is updated.
The Ombudsman understood that, by also referring to its new rules, which explicitly mention the non-disclosure of fi finance contracts, the EIB indicated that the established practice was, in light of the confidential dential banking relationship between itself and its business partners, not to disclose finance contracts under any circumstances, and thus not to assess the possibility of partial disclosure.
Moreover, they argue that in light of the Union's climate policies the exemption would strengthen the competitiveness of energy-intensive undertakings and therefore prevent them from shifting their activities to outside of the Union, which would result in negative consequences for the Union's economy, as it would e.g. lead to a loss of value chains and increase the Union's dependency on imports.

But along this road the loving support of a few helped me to hold strong in faith when my own faith wavered.As I look back on my experience after some years, I see how faltering I was in walking through the trial in faith, yet I did the best I could in light of the stress and the depth of the grief.
In light of the above, the Commission has concluded that sufficient evidence exists to justify the initiation of an investigation pursuant to Article 13(3) of the basic Regulation and to make imports of the product under investigation, whether declared as originating in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and Tunisia or not, subject to registration, in accordance with Article 14(5) of the basic Regulation.
In light of the comments received it was considered nevertheless, that given the very small volume of exports represented by the single cooperating exporting producer to which neither MET nor IT was granted, it would be more appropriate to base the calculation of the countrywide duty also on import data from Eurostat, based on an average weight of 500 grams per saddle.
In light of those considerations, it does not appear that the effects restrictive of competition such as those resulting for members of the Bar practising in the Netherlands from a regulation such as the 1993 Regulation go beyond what is necessary in order to ensure the proper practice of the legal profession (see, to that effect, Case C-250/92 DLG [1994], paragraph 35).
Where observations are submitted by a person or entity designated in accordance with Article 2(2) or Article 3(3) and (4), the Council shall review the designation in light of those observations and the measures shall cease to apply if the Council determines, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 5, that the conditions for their application are no longer met.
In light of the Human Rights Agenda for the European Union for the Year 2000 taken up by the Committee of the Wise Men, would the Commission state its position on the drawing up of an action plan and a draft directive on equal treatment so as to bring an end to the widespread discrimination in the EU based on sexual orientation?
In light of the documentation available, and the comments or the absence of comments of the parties concerned, the Commission considers that the Mobile Phone ‘Expert XP-Ex-1’ fails to comply with the essential health and safety requirements referred to in Article 3 of the Directive 94/9/EC and set out in Annex II, in particular in points 1.0.5 (Marking) and 1.3 (Potential ignition sources).
In these circumstances, it was considered that a cumulative assessment of imports from the USA with the dumped imports from the PRC, Russia and Ukraine was not appropriate in light of the conditions of competition between the imports from the USA and, on the one hand, the dumped imports from the three countries concerned and, on the other hand, the like Community product.
The Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Croatia represents an efficient means for the EU and Croatia to reduce and impede the trade in, and consumption of, drugs on the basis of the sharing of data and experience in relation to drugs and their abuse, and in light of the fact that one EU citizen dies of an overdose every hour.
In particular, in light of their limited risk to civil aviation safety, aircraft that are of simple design or operate mainly on a local basis, and those which are home-built or particularly rare or only exist in a small number, should remain under the regulatory control of the Member States, without any obligation under this Regulation on other Member States to recognise such national arrangements.
The notion of ‘inextricably linked offences’ should be considered in light of the relevant case-law which, for the application of the ne bis in idem principle, retains as a relevant criterion the identity of the material facts (or facts which are substantially the same), understood in the sense of the existence of a set of concrete circumstances which are inextricably linked together in time and space.
The first BDO Noraudit Report of 23 March 2009 (‘the first BDO Report’) provides an explanation of how the three measures [20] did not entail any over-compensation when examined in light of the combined increased costs for the whole Hurtigruten fleet related to (i) the introduction of the NOx tax (for 2007 and the first half of 2008), and (ii) the increased fuel prices in 2008.
Another further issue to be debated by Parliament in the following years in light of the efficiency of the Stability and Growth Pact is the extent of freedom to be granted to Member States for the possible reduction of VAT rates, and whether the standard rates or the individual exemptions from standard rates are most likely to distort the market (if they distort it at all).
It is therefore concluded that the total spare capacity of the EU and third producers outside the EU is sufficient to complement in the short term the potential decrease in Chinese imports in light of the demand for PV installations in the EU as forecasted for 2013 (between 9,8 GW and 16,5 GW) and 2014 (9 GW and 17,1 GW) by major research centres such as EPIA.
The Greek authorities and PCT argue that in light of Articles 34 and 33(4) of the VAT code relevant to the ‘investment good’, the provision under examination merely consists in a clarification of the generally applicable rules in order to avoid mistaken application of the VAT credit refund rules by the tax authorities in view of the particularities and the high amounts involved in big infrastructure projects.
This shows that the crisis is already hitting the real economy in no uncertain terms and therefore I propose to the Commission that we take a look at one of the responses and investigate the law on subsidies, which we are now abandoning as far as the banks are concerned and that suddenly has no effect any more, and change it in light of the present crisis.
In light of the findings set out in paragraphs 158 to 164 above, the Court holds that the Commission breached its duty under Article 253 EC to state reasons by failing to provide the slightest explanation regarding the application of the principle of equal treatment in the contested decision, in the Commission Communication of 7 July 2004 or in the context of the adoption of those measures .
Accordingly, I should like to withdraw amendments 1 to 7 in light of the fact that, as Mr Battersby said, certain of their aspects have already been taken on board in the proposal, and I regard as positive and constructive his assurance that the points we raised and the questions we sought to air through these amendments would be taken up at a future date rather than now.
In light of those principles, for the purposes of examining whether the financing of the full exemption, as resulting from the second sentence of Paragraph 19(2) of the StromNEV 2011, involves State resources, it is necessary to differentiate between the financing of the full exemption in 2011 and the financing of that exemption during the years 2012 and 2013, that is to say following the introduction of the § 19-surcharge.
(91) In view of the magnitude of the dumping margins found for the exporting producers in Russia and in light of the level of the injury caused to the Community industry, it is considered necessary that the amounts secured by way of provisional anti-dumping duty imposed by the provisional Regulation, i.e. Commission Regulation (EC) No 1235/2003, should be definitively collected to the extent of the amount of definitive duties imposed.
A high level independent mediator will be appointed in 2011 and tasked with exploring possible approaches with a view to harmonising the methodology used to impose levies, improve the administration of levies, specifically the type of equipment that is subject to levies, the setting of tariff rates, and the inter-operability of the various national systems in light of the cross-border effects that a disparate levy system has on the internal market.
In light of these circumstances, the Commission considers that setting the initial maturity at seven years can be considered the minimum necessary to allow the subordinated loans provided by Latvia to fully qualify as Tier 2 capital and ensure that Parex banka achieved the target capital adequacy ratio, for reasons of preserving the stability within the Latvian banking system, as well as of complying with the commitment to sell the bank.
In the case of level 2 findings, where the service provider fails to submit a corrective action plan that is acceptable to the competent authority in light of the finding, or where the service provider fails to perform the corrective action within the time period accepted or extended by the competent authority, the finding may be raised to a level 1 finding, and action taken as laid down in point (1).
In light of recent shocks to the energy market such as the increase in oil prices and heightened public concern over the effects of climate change, what is the Council under the UK Presidency doing to ensure that the proposed directive on energy end-use efficiency and energy services (COM(2003)0739 – C5-0642/2003 – 2003/0300(COD)) takes into account the more rigorous measures to encourage energy saving supported by a strong majority in Parliament?
In light of the above considerations, it is concluded that the product concerned is aluminium foil of a thickness of not less than 0,008 mm and not more than 0,018 mm, not backed, not further worked than rolled, in rolls of a width not exceeding 650 mm and of a weight exceeding 10 kg originating in Armenia, Brazil and the People’s Republic of China falling within CN code ex76071119 (product concerned).
In light of the documentation available, the comments of the parties concerned and the report of the independent expert, the Commission considers that the guided type fall arrester of the type HACA Leitern 0529.7102 fails to comply with BHSRs 1, 1.1.1 and 3.1.2.2 of Annex II to Directive 89/686/EEC, since it does not adequately prevent falls in a ‘fall-back’ situation, and that this non-conformity gives rise to a serious risk for users,
This initiative was all the more appropriate in light of the importance of the automotive industry1, which employs around twelve million people in Europe (in production plants in 19 Member States), makes R & D investments of over EUR 28 billion every year, has a positive trade balance in the region of EUR 90 billion, and contributes over EUR 430 billion to the Member States' tax revenues, i.e. 4% of European GDP.
For the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2, the appropriate measures shall be determined in light of the nature of the content in question, the harm it may cause, the characteristics of the category of persons to be protected as well as the rights and legitimate interests at stake, including those of the video-sharing platform providers and the users having created or uploaded the content as well as the general public interest.
Based on this logic developed by the ECJ, and in light of the indications provided for in relevant case-law of the ECtHR, it can be derived that enjoyment of the other rights enumerated in Article 14(1) of the Return Directive (such as in particular access to education and taking into account needs of vulnerable persons) also give rise to a concomitant requirement to make provision for the basic needs of the third-country national concerned.
In light of the Commission proposals establishing the Fund for the Integration of legally staying third country nationals, the Fund for the return of illegally staying third country nationals (hereafter ‘Return Fund’) and the external borders Fund for the period 2007-2013, as part of the general programme ‘Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows’, in particular in view of setting out common management, control and evaluation arrangements, a new European Refugee Fund should be established.
In light of those facts — that is, the structure of the market, the position of the EBU in the market for certain international sporting events and the level of vertical integration of the EBU and its members — there is reason to determine whether the scheme for third­party access to the Eurovision system makes it possible to counterbalance the restrictions on competition affecting those third parties and thus to avoid their exclusion from competition.
"On 19-20 March 2009, the European Council examined the report prepared by the High-Level Group on Supervision, chaired by Mr. Jacques de Larosière, in light of the ensuing Commission Communication on "Driving European Recovery" and concluded by agreeing "on the need to improve the regulation and supervision of financial institutions in the EU and that the report from the High Level Group on financial supervision chaired by Jacques de Larosière is the basis for action.
SWEDISH MATCH PHILIPPINES V COUNCIL established in relation to the imports from each country is more than de minimis as defined in Article 9(3) [= 2%] and that the volume of imports from each country is not negligible; and (b) a cumulative assessment of the effects of the imports is appropriate in light of the conditions of competition between imported products and the conditions of competition between the imported products and the like Community product.
Urges the Commission to demonstrate the Union added value of the agricultural market measures bearing in mind the risk of potential losses affecting the budget of the Union and asks the Commission to consider their suppression if this risk is too high; asks the Commission to report in the 2013 Commission discharge follow-up report on the actions taken by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) in light of the audit mission for poultry export refunds in France;
Given the tax advisor's choice of the TNMM in the transfer pricing analysis and in light of the observations above, the Commission is of the opinion that, to ensure an appropriate market-based level of remuneration to FFT for the financing and treasury functions it performs within the Fiat group in line with the arm's length principle, that remuneration should be established on the basis of FFT's accounting equity on the basis of its specific facts and circumstances.
In light of the documentation available, and the comments of the parties concerned, the Commission considers that the fluorescent lamp, mark and type ‘GW 80 455’, in its configuration as analysed by the Swedish authorities making reference to the harmonised standard EN 60079-0:2006, failed to comply with the essential health and safety requirements referred to in Article 3 of the Directive 94/9/EC and set out in Annex II, in particular in points 1.0.5 (Marking) and 1.0.6 (Instructions).
Could the Council say if the French Presidency would be supportive of asking Eurostat to recommend implementation of the UN Handbook on non-profit institutions in the system of national accounts in light of the fact that this is one area of the statistical system that touches the citizens of Europe in a direct way and therefore validates the involvement of citizens in voluntary activities by giving it explicit visibility in the statistical system for the first time?
(ES) Mr President, Commissioner, the position of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) is very clear as far as the European Union's trade policy is concerned. We are firm defenders of free trade and it is certainly vital that Europe continues negotiating trade agreements with other countries because they generate new opportunities for European companies, that is to say, new jobs, which are very much required in light of the serious current economic crisis.
In light of the documentation available, the comments expressed and the action taken by the parties concerned, the Commission considers that the hearing protector earplugs of the type Climax 13 (reusable model) fails to comply with clauses § 4.1.1, 4.2.2, 4.3.6, 5 and 6 of the harmonised standard EN 352-2:1993 referring to the basic health and safety requirements (BHSR) 1.4 and 3.5 set out in Annex II to Directive 89/686/EEC, since it could cause injury when being inserted into the ear,
Having regards to the Decision of 15 November 2012 and the Implementing Decision 2014/715/EU, and to the dialogue process with Sri Lanka entertained by the Commission and its outcome, it can be concluded that the actions undertaken by Sri Lanka in light of its duties as flag State are insufficient to comply with Articles 94, 117 and 118 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and Articles 18, 19 and 20 of United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement.
Therefore, in light of the results of national groundwater monitoring programmes, and bearing in mind the need to ensure a level of safety and protection consistent with the high level of protection that is sought within the Union, it is appropriate to provide for a renewal of the approval of bentazone for a period of seven years which ensures a priority re-assessment of bentazone over other active substances thereby also allowing to take into consideration updated results of national groundwater monitoring programmes.
Notes that an independent third party ICT security audit was carried out on all parliamentary ICT and telecommunications systems with a view to completing a clear roadmap towards a more robust ICT security policy in 2015; points out the ICT security audit was due in December 2014; reiterates that in light of the recent elevated security threat, this should be a priority, asks that its Committee on Budgetary Control to be informed on the results as soon as the report has been finalised;
However, the assessment of the ability of the person concerned to remain in the executing Member State after his sentence has been served, in light of the fact that he does not reside there in conformity with the national legislation governing the right of foreign nationals to enter and remain in the country and the fact that he has systematically committed crimes there, must be carried out by the executing judicial authority in accordance with the requirements of Community law and fundamental rights.
In addition, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission in respect of amending the reference in this Regulation to the environmental protection requirements contained in Amendment 12 of Volume I, Amendment 9 of Volume II, and in the initial issue of Volume III, all as applicable on 1 January 2018, of Annex 16 to the Chicago Convention, in order to update them in light of subsequent amendments to Annex 16 to that Convention.
It should also be noted that the Commission provided ample time to any interested party to submit requested information and conducted the investigation in line with the provisions of Annex VI of the SCM Agreement setting out the rules for on-the-spot verifications which inter alia allow requests made on-the-spot for further details in light of the information obtained. (290) The GOC argued that the requested Plans were voluminous as they contain 282000 pages and thus it is an unreasonable extra burden to translate them.
In light of the obligations imposed by Directive 2014/61/EU, the competent authorities, in particular, local authorities, should also establish appropriate coordination procedures, in cooperation with national regulatory authorities, with respect to public works and other appropriate public facilities or property which should be able to include procedures that ensure that interested parties have information concerning appropriate public facilities or property and ongoing and planned public works, that they are notified in a timely manner of such works, and that sharing is facilitated to the maximum extent possible.
Otherwise, integrated group companies would benefit from a favourable treatment under the ordinary rules of taxation of corporate profit when it comes to the determination of their taxable base which is not available to non-integrated standalone companies, leading to unequal treatment between companies that are factually and legally in a similar situation in light of the objective of those rules, which is to tax the profits of all companies falling under its scope of taxation, since both companies' taxable profit is taxed at the same corporate income tax rate.
During its 6-8 November 2007 meeting, the CVMP, in light of the overall data submitted and the scientific discussion within the Committee, adopted by consensus an opinion that since the product is intended for use in a minor species (horses) that is reared and treated similarly to a major species, the conclusions on the Environmental Risk Assessment of the major species apply, and therefore the product should be exempt from providing a Phase II assessment and no risk mitigation measures should be included in the SPC of the product.
In light of the above , the ECB suggests including , on the basis of a cost benefit analysis , management companies in the definition of a regulated entity laid down in Article 2 ( 4 ) and thus subject them to supplementary supervision according to the proposal . Secondly , the ECB would suggest that the threshold specified in Article 3 ( 1 ) could include off-balance sheet items for the purposes of the calculation of the relevance of the banking and investment sectors within a group .
However, in light of the particular nature of the SGEI mission relied on in this case, which consists in the obligation for all operators active on the Irish PMI market to comply with a number of obligations characterised by the contested decision as SGEI obligations, and which the Community judicature has thus far never had to consider, it is appropriate to apply the criteria formulated in Altmark, in accordance with the spirit and the purpose which prevailed when they were laid down, in a manner adapted to the particular facts of the present case.
In light of this situation, it is my intention henceforth to join the Pontifical Commission "Ecclesia Dei" – the body which has been competent since 1988 for those communities and persons who, coming from the Society of Saint Pius X or from similar groups, wish to return to full communion with the Pope – to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. This will make it clear that the problems now to be addressed are essentially doctrinal in nature and concern primarily the acceptance of the Second Vatican Council and the post-conciliar magisterium of the Popes.
(19) Since the objective of this Directive, namely ensuring an adequate level for the security of gas supply, in particular in the event of a major supply disruption, whilst contributing to the proper functioning of the internal gas market, cannot, in all circumstances, be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, particularly in light of the increasing interdependency of the Member States regarding security of gas supply, and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.
Where imports of a product from more than one country are simultaneously subject to countervailing duty investigations, the investigating authorities may cumulatively assess the effects of such imports only in they determine that (a) the amount of subsidization established in relation to the imports from each country is more than de minimis as defined in paragraph 9 of Article 11 and the volume of imports from each country is not negligible, and (b) a cumulative assessment of the effects of the imports is appropriate in light of the conditions of competition between the imported products and the conditions of competition between the imported products and the like domestic product.
The Commission anticipates that, in light of access prices in Member States observed and bearing in mind the potential for limited local cost variations, the application of the key features of the recommended costing methodology, i.e. being based on a modern efficient network, reflecting the need for stable and predictable wholesale copper access prices over time, and dealing appropriately and consistently with the impact of declining volumes, and of the methodologies used pursuant to point 40, is likely to lead to stable copper access prices and a Union average monthly rental access price for the full unbundled copper local loop within a band between €8 and €10 (net of all taxes) expressed in 2012 prices (the price band).
When a provider that is, on an exceptional basis, designated to provide tariff options or packages different from those provided under normal commercial conditions, as identified in accordance with this Directive or to ensure the availability at a fixed location of an adequate broadband internet access service or voice communications services, as identified in accordance with this Directive, chooses to dispose of a substantial part, viewed in light of its universal service obligations, or all, of its local access network assets in the national territory to a separate legal entity under different ultimate ownership, the competent authority should assess the effects of the transaction in order to ensure the continuity of universal service obligations in all or parts of the national territory.
The GOC claimed that the BB rating applied to the sampled exporting producers (for the purpose of the loan benchmark) is ‘extremely unfavourable’ and that the Commission ‘in light of the actual facts of the case did not explain how did it come to the conclusion that this is the accurate or most reasonable conclusion. The GOC further claimed that this methodology amounts to “an impermissible adverse inference”.’ Although this claim was made in relation to the one of the previous cases (i.e. Coated Fine Paper) and before the disclosure of the information concerning the rating applied to the sample exporting producers in this proceeding, it should be noted that the Commission did not apply ‘adverse facts available’ in this case or in any other cases to which the GOC referred in its submission.
Notes that during 2013, the Agency reviewed 213 declarations of interests in light of the ‘Code of Conduct for the staff of EASA’ adopted in 2012; welcomes the revision of the EASA Regulation and emphasises the need to revise the code of conduct in order to avoid any potential conflicts of interests; proposes that in this regard, there should be a regular screening of the implementation of the code of conduct and the cases themselves by the Court of Auditors; points out that two cases of revolving doors were identified in 2013; notes that the Agency has permitted the notified activities for both revolving door cases under the conditions not to contact and not to lobby the Agency's staff members and to abstain from direct contract negotiations with the Agency during a cooling-off period of 12 to 24 months;
In line with Article 2(10)(i) the Commission analysed various factors and established, inter alia, that: (i) in light of the written contracts, there was a consistent mark-up charged by a related company in the PRC to the related traders abroad; (ii) those written contracts suggested that traders assumed the customer default risk; (iii) the main activity of the related traders, amounting to more than 95 % of their turnover, consisted of trading products other than the product concerned including trading activities with unrelated parties; (iv) traders were paying compensation for quality claims made by customers; (v) traders were paying sea freight and bank charges in export sales of the product concerned to the Union; (vi) the business licence of one of the related traders described its main activities as ‘wholesale on a fee or contract basis, e.g. commission agents’; (vii) based on the verified profit and loss sheet, the related traders' own profit covered relevant office expenditures; (viii) traders were not located at the premises or near the producers and kept their accounting records at their premises.
In light of the increasing convergence between the sectors providing electronic communications services, and the horizontal dimension of regulatory issues related to their development, BEREC and the BEREC Office should be allowed to cooperate with, and without prejudice to the role of, NRAs, other Union bodies, offices, agencies and advisory groups, in particular the Radio Spectrum Policy Group established by Commission Decision 2002/622/EC, the European Data Protection Supervisor established by Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the European Data Protection Board established by Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the European Regulators Group for Audiovisual Media Services established by the Directive 2010/13/EU of the European Parliament and the Council, the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security established by Regulation (EU) No 526/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the European GNSS Agency established by Regulation (EU) No 912/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council, the Consumer Protection Cooperation Network established pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and the Council, the European Competition Network and European standardisation organisations, as well as with existing committees (such as the Communications Committee and the Radio Spectrum Committee).
