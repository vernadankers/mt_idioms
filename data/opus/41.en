As a rule of thumb, for high fixed cost media such as good quality television and computer­based learning, in­house or commissioned production is uneconomical (i.e. has higher unit costs than conventional training) unless each course averages 500 students or more a year (or 3 000 to 5 000 in total), or costs are recovered through sales of programmes or hiring out production fa­cilities.
Let me once again remind you that the flexibility instrument, the annual upper limit of which the May 1999 agreement set at EUR 200 million, is intended to deal with unforeseen eventualities, and also that heading 24 of the Interinstitutional Agreement states that, as a rule, this flexibility instrument should not be applied for one and the same purpose in two successive financial years.
As a rule, the substitution of a new contractual partner for the one to which the contracting authority had initially awarded the contract must be regarded as constituting a change to one of the essential terms of the public contract in question, unless that substitution was provided for in the terms of the initial contract, such as, by way of example, provision for sub-contracting.
As a rule civil wars logically tend to spread, with the result that the regional powers very quickly become involved and with the result that in the end quite different conflicts enter into play in the region and large and powerful states, which also have their own particular history and conflicts of interest that have not yet been resolved, border conflicts, become directly involved.

However, whilst the draft Directive makes provision for frontier workers to be taxed in the country where they reside, the Committee would have a so-called frontier worker defined as being « any worker employed in the territory of a Member State and residing in the territory of another Member State to which he returns as a rule daily or at least once a week ».
As explained at recital 154, the whole of the residual profit resulting from intra-group transactions should, as a rule, be considered the central entrepreneur's arm's length profit, in line with the entrepreneurial risks and connected costs borne by it (i.e. costs, if any, of managing or mitigating the risk, costs that may arise from the realisation of the risk), as central entrepreneur in the group structure.
The percentage of subjects who discover this shortcut or ‘hidden rule’ when they are retested is 22% in the awake group versus 60% in the sleep group. Thus, the discovery of a complex rule, one of the most sophisticated human cognitive activities, becomes much easier after a night of sleep even if the test person did not know that there was a rule to be discovered.
As a rule, these fares involve an obligation to spend the night of Saturday/Sunday at the place of mission.Thus, where the night of Saturday/Sunday is separated by only 24 hours from the start or end of the mission, the Mission Travel Office will suggest that officials bring forward or delay their mission at the General Secretariat's expense provided, of course, that this measure significantly reduces the cost.
To the (limited) extent that there is a need to implement Union legislation at Union level, the Group considers that the Treaty should make the general regime on implementing measures (i.e., presently, but subject to a wider discussion on reform in the Convention, Article 211 TEC: implementing measures taken, as a rule, by the Commission in comitology procedures) also applicable in the areas of the current "Third Pillar".

The communities and regions, which sprang from the constitutional reforms, are the constituent parts of the federal Belgian state established in 1993. As a rule of thumb, one can say that the communities are responsible for 'individual-related matters' (language, culture, education, health care, social aid, etc.), while the regions are responsible for 'territorial matters' (such as road infrastructure, water, the environment, land division, housing, spatial planning, and regional economic affairs).
However, the practice of some owners of tenanted public houses to allow the tenant to conclude contracts for the installation of such machines only with certain undertakings which the owner recommends is, as a rule, incompatible with this Regulation, unless the undertakings are selected on the basis of objective criteria of a qualitative nature that are the same for all potential providers of such equipment and are applied in a nondiscriminatory manner.
The argument put forward by the Court of First Instance that, in so far as the principles of transparency, openness, democracy and the participation of citizens in the decisionmaking process underlie all the provisions in that regulation, the overriding public interest capable of justifying the disclosure of a document by way of derogation from the general confidentiality of legal advice must, as a rule, be distinct from those principles does not convince me.

It depends on the image, but many of the images restrict against commercial usage. The Image Viewer's statusbar will usually contain information about the image's copyright holder, and what usage restrictions apply. As a rule of thumb: anything published by NASA is in the public domain (including all HST images). For everything else, you can pretty safely assume that the images may not be used commercially without permission. When in doubt, contact the image's copyright holder directly.
According to our marketing rules (see "How is marketing to 3rd parties regulated "), our goal is to fill the unoccupied housing space 10 days prior to arrival.As a rule, our employees in the resorts still reserve some space for short-term inquiries from Shareholders and Members, since they can control the quotas on booking.com flexibly.Thus, if there are still apartments in a special resort to be booked on booking.com, there should also be free apartments for Shareholders and Members.

It is clear from the case­law that whilst, as a rule, the enforcement of copyright by its holder, as in the case of the prohibition on importing certain products from outside the Community in to a Member State of the Community, is not in itself a breach of Article 86 of the Treaty, such enforcement may, in exceptional circumstances, involve abusive conduct (Joined Cases C­241/91 Ρ and C­242/91 Ρ RTE and ITP ν Commission [1995] ECR I­743, paragraphs 49 and 50).
While the exercise of this right is to be facilitated, the fact that, at the present stage, social assistance provision is not covered by Community law and is not, as a rule, “exportable”, entails that a completely equal treatment as regards social benefits is not possible without running the risk of certain categories of people entitled to the right of residence, in particular those not engaged in gainful activity, becoming an unreasonable on the public finances of the host Member State.
An institution may apply to the national central bank in the Member State in which the institution is resident for permission to hold all its minimum reserves indirectly through an intermediary. The possibility of holding minimum reserves through an intermediary is, as a rule, restricted to institutions which are constituted in such a way that part of the administration (e.g. treasury management) is normally effected by the intermediary (e.g. networks of savings banks and cooperative banks may centralise their reserve holdings).

Having regard to the proposal from the Commission, their volumes and duties; the most suitable method for managing the tariff quota for products of CN code ex 0406 is based on import licences and should be carried out by the Commission; the other tariff quotas should be managed, as a rule, on a first­come first­served basis in accordance with Articles 30Sa to 308c of Regu­lation (EEQ No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code O;
In that respect, it is correct that, as the Belgian Government observed, the Court accepted in the Schumacker line of cases — thereby recognising the role of the criterion of residence as a connecting factor for purposes of the allocation of taxing powers — that, in relation to direct taxes, the respective situations of residents and nonresidents are not, as a rule, comparable, so that, in tax law, it is possible that the taxpayer’s residence may constitute a factor justifying national rules which entail different treatment as between resident and nonresident taxpayers. 23
In that regard, Mr Turco complains that the Court of First Instance erred in finding that the overriding public interest capable of justifying the disclosure of a document must, as a rule, be distinct from the principles underlying Regulation No 1049/2001, that is to say, the principles of transparency, openness and democracy or of the participation of citizens in the decisionmaking process, unless the applicant shows that, having regard to the specific facts of the case, the invocation of those principles is so pressing that it overrides the need to protect the document in question.

As explained in recital 101 of decision C 56/2007 cited above, to which the Commission refers mutatis mutandis, the French authorities have also noted the misgivings set out by the Commission in recital 71 of the opening decision, which indicated that the plea of accepted risk was a rule established by case-law that could develop; that it was based on secondary law instruments which could be annulled in the event of conflict; and, finally, that the proposal of the French authorities did not cover all possible scenarios, since debts could be not only financial but also commercial or other forms of debt again.
1.3 Thus, if a person comes to carry out an occupational activity in Portugal without, under the Regulations, maintaining links with the social security legislation of his or her Member State of origin he or she will as a rule be subject to the provisions of the general social security scheme, with the possibility, under certain conditions, that periods of cover completed under the legislation of one or more Member States will be taken into consideration by Portuguese institutions for the purposes of acquiring entitlement or for the calculation of the benefits provided by Portuguese legislation, as is the case, among others, of the old-age pension.

Planet positions are only accurate for dates within 4000 years or so of the current epoch. The planet positions are predicted using a Fourier-like analysis of their orbits, as observed over the past few centuries. We learnt in school that planets follow simple elliptical orbits around the Sun, but this is not strictly true. It would be true only if there was only one planet in the Solar system, and if the Sun and the planet were both point masses. As it is, the planets are constantly tugging on each other, perturbing the orbits slightly, and tidal effects also induce precessional wobbling. In fact, recent analysis suggests that the planets' orbits may not even be stable in the long term (i. e., millions or billions of years). As a rule of thumb, you can expect the position of a planet to be accurate to a few arcseconds between the dates -2000 and 6000.

Whereas provision should be made for block exemption of liner conferences; whereas liner conferences have a stabilizing effect, assuring shippers of reliable services; whereas they contribute generally to providing adequate efficient scheduled maritime transport services and give fair consideration to the interests of users; whereas such results cannot be obtained without the cooperation that shipping companies promote within conferences in relation to rates and, where appropriate, availability of capacity or allocation of cargo for shipment, and income; whereas in most cases conferences continue to be subject to effective competition from both non-conference scheduled services and, in certain circumstances, from tramp services and from other modes of transport; whereas the mobility of fleets, which is a characteristic feature of the structure of availability in the shipping field, subjects conferences to constant competition which they are unable as a rule to eliminate as far as a substantial proportion of the shipping services in question is concerned;
