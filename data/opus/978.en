But everyone knows that there’s no rest for the wicked – when the late hour strikes, bikinis are swapped for Martinis and restaurants turn their tables and become clubs.
There'll be no rest for the wicked today, Egghead.
And the last one, No Rest for the Wicked ends with you going to hell.
No rest for the wicked fighters.
