part in the Committee on Social Affairs, by means of the dialogue which we shall begin with the new Commissioner responsible, we hope to initiate a policy relating to the less well off and to development, a policy which in the final analysis will help citizens who may thus become leaders of society in our stand.
Debate continues on whether the degree of flexibility in determining the applicable law should be reduced where there is no electio legis or, at least, the appearance of flexibility should be reduced which in the final analysis is not wanted by the Rome Convention itself, when the presumptions of Article 4(2) are interpreted in a certain way.
In the final analysis, the present split in Europe is an expression of the confrontation between on the one hand democracy and on the other the most extremist form of dictatorship. In theory our free world faces the latter with an Atlantic Alliance and a European Community, not to mention the various specialist councils, unions and organizations.
Indeed, in the final analysis it reveals itself as essentially a political issue.The modern feminist movement has, therefore, fong emphasized the political education of women and their participation in public affairs.It has also fought to obtain the vote for women together with other political and legal rights, thereby hoping to change the prevailing power balance between the sexes.
Just as it is a pity that the transport Commissioner cannot be here, it is a good sign that the Commissioner for the environment is here, because, in the final analysis, traffic, and railway traffic in particular, is a means to an end and not an end in itself and it should help to improve our environmental situation.
In the final analysis, many remarks made in this meeting will also be of interest to Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, but since she has reminded me of this question, which, as I have already said, I would have addressed at a later stage, let me just say that this is of course an issue pertaining to the internal market.
Because in the final analysis, with the spectre of enlargement looming closer, and with the unknown consequences of this enlargement, particularly in terms of agricultural expenditure, the only way we can assure that we have a Community to which all Europeans will aspire is by keeping funds separately on one side to finance the policies they wish to see.
As it is the Member States which in the final analysis will implement the proposed freezing of suspected terrorists' financial assets and as this must in any case be carried out through measures within each Member State, there is nothing to suggest that an EU regulation is required or that it will speed up the implementation of necessary measures.
In the final analysis, while some people may profess to have no great expectations concerning the outcome of our visit to Beijing, is it not true to say that this really only concerns the participants themselves and that the conference must be judged in the light of the implementation process put in place afterwards? I am optimistic about Beijing.
it is jobbing, and it is an abuse of Community law. With it the Council is telling us quite clearly that pay ment undertakings given by the European Community are less important and less binding than national undertakings; European budget rules take second place . . . and in the final analysis this is what the quarrel is all about.
Therefore, an area to which we believe it would have been more consistent to have applied Article 235 of the Treaty has been encompassed under the heading of'public health', even though in the final analysis Article 235 allows for powers of action that are not specifically provided for, where Community action proves necessary to achieve one of the Community's objectives.
Malerba framework programme, keeping them on as reciprocal a level as possible. This criterion of reciprocity should be geared to stimulating collaboration in areas where toe emerging economies have already shown a high level of competence and competitiveness, and in the final analysis that is the core of the Pompidou report, which I naturally recommend to the approval of Parliament.
to make use of radiation, it became clear that it was essential to carry out basic research to find out more about what happens in irradiated matter, to determine what doses and conditions would yield the best results and, lastly, to make certain that the irradiated products, which in the final analysis are intended for human consumption, would be innocuous.
So I hope that together, working with the Council, we will manage to give a sufficiently strong political impetus so that in the final analysis, at the end of this year, we succeed with these negotiations, rather than merely concluding them, and that together we demonstrate a collective political courage that goes beyond considerations based merely on caution or national interests.
Therefore, an area to which we believe it would have been more consistent to have applied Article 235 of the Treaty has been encompassed under the heading of 'public health', even though in the final analysis Article 235 allows for powers of action that are not specifically provided for, where Community action proves necessary to achieve one of the Community's objectives.
The accession of Spain and Portugal has complicated rather than eased the situation as regards ships and that being so, I think that in spite of the tight budget in 1987 we will consistently have to do more for the three pillars which in the final analysis support the European Community. These three pillars are: (a) control, (b) research and (c) structure.
And then there are those who are convinced that it is only a matter of time until man will be artificially reproducible, for the simple reason that in the final analysis every one of us is composed of positive and negative charges, which we ourselves with a bit of patience and expertise could classify and arrange in the format of our choice.
We Christian Democrats are firmly convinced that in the final analysis only a jointly planning and jointly acting European Police Office subject to the executive authority of the Commission - although not with this Vice-President - parliamentary supervision by Parliament and judicial control by the Court of Justice of the European Community stands a chance of organizing the fight against crime effectively.
In the final analysis, however, we must find a way forward, because if we carry on as we have in the past, and with last year' s experience, then what will happen is that the security debate and the debate about citizens' rights will be marginalised in the national parliaments as a result of making it a half national, half European structure.
In the final analysis a policy of this kind is, of course, completely to the consumer's disadvantage, because all kinds of dangerous or at least dubious things go into a product that has long since ceased to be worthy of the name chocolate, because it is adulterated with additives, because it is no longer fresh and because there is no right to information.
Fourthly, even though the prevention and resolution of conflicts by non-military means will always be at the heart of any security strategy adopted by the European Union, the credibility of the European Foreign and Security Policy is, in the final analysis, dependent on the quality of its military capabilities and on the political willingness to deploy them in the event of any conflict.
I therefore hope that the signing will take place alongside the forthcoming meeting of the General Affairs Council and it is my own earnest hope that this signing will take place with the benefit of an opinion from this Parliament, which will almost certainly be critical and severe but I hope that the positive and promising aspects will predominate in the final analysis.
It should not be forgotten that the basis of calculation has changed over the last three or four years, and that the GDP of Member States, at Community level, has increased by 2.5 %. So we must compare like with like, and it should not be insinuated that, in the final analysis, the Community is spending less than it was some four years ago.
The signatories to this motion are careful not to mention what and who is to blame for the under-development and misery in which three-quarters of humanity is kept, in other words, the major industrial and financial groups and their imperialist government lackeys, which rate the economy of our planet and, in the final analysis, the existence of its entire population below the profit motive.
In the final analysis, what matters is safety and fair competition on the roads and, in this light, it is of the utmost importance for each driver to have had adequate training before they use the public roads, and for them to be able to specialise and receive continuous training, and for the requirements to be equivalent in all Member States and accession countries.
In the final analysis commodity production is the result of the development of division of labor and of the relative rise of the productive forces resulting from this division of labor. It is preceded by an epoch of general poverty in which the limited production and consumption of use-values is based on the extreme minimum of human needs and on the weak social productivity of labor.
My second proposal for action: in this society and in particular in its economic and social organization we face the danger, as a post-industrial society, of finding that, in the final analysis, the social facilities which should be installed are, overall, too costly and that the human being is too expensive to be kept alive, to be born, to be educated, to manage his own affairs.
It is thus becoming clear that powers must be transferred beyond the national responsibility of Member States to Community level, on the one hand to improve planning, but also in subsequent measures besides the planning of transport infrastructures that include Central and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, to secure the resources actually required, i.e. in the final analysis to ensure that financing is made available.
That is something we owe not only to our partners, but also, in the final analysis, to the European public, which expects us to come up with solutions and has no interest in, or sympathy with, interinstitutional squabbles, and would certainly be disappointed if we were unable, from January 2007 onwards, to give overseas aid to the extent that we have all, together, undertaken to do.
From the wide range of opinions in the Council of Agriculture Ministers, which, in the final analysis, is strengthening Mac Sharry's position despite views to the contrary, it should be clear to Parliament that it will gain acceptance for its concept only if it forms a united front and that only an environmentally oriented agricultural policy can count on the support of the public as a whole.
The data should be used solely for the purpose of combating terrorism, and not with any other ends in view, and, in the final analysis, it is highly problematic in legal terms that citizens of the European Union should not be on an equal footing with citizens of the United States; it is not acceptable that our citizens should enjoy fewer rights than do their American counterparts.
Responsibility for developing and enriching the list rests with the Commission, and above all with the national governments which have lodged incomplete lists, to the detriment of quality and consumer protection and, in the final analysis, the competitiveness of the small and mediumsized businesses which mainly manufacture these products, basically because they do not attach proper importance to projection of the special characteristics of their countries' foodstuffs.
Finally, we should like the procedures for granting subsidies to be speeded up so that the 1982 harvest can benefit from them; otherwise Greek cotton-workers stand to make substantial losses which in the final analysis would harm the Community as a whole since, as we have said, Greek cotton is a supplementary product and the Community has a special interest in encouraging such products in the Member States.
I think that that is a very important point, and - although I risk the reproach that in the final analysis the Council has made a declaration which does not match its willingness and determination to achieve zero growth in the 1998 budget - I would say that the Council is sufficiently realistic and reasonable to share Parliament's view of all the legal obligations of the European Union.
Although the report tends to interfere with the labour and social legislation of the Member States, by proposing the regulation of pension funds at European level, not only for the capitals market but also for the social security systems of their beneficiaries, I have in the final analysis supported it, since it expresses the correct options for this field which, incidentally, are being adopted by the Portuguese Government.
The North Korean leadership seems willing to be open and to pursue dialogue with South Korea, the United States, Europe and Japan, and although, in the final analysis, they must be judged on their actions, I am convinced that a European policy of dialogue, structured and critical dialogue, will make a significant contribution to changes in the Democratic People' s Republic of Korea that will benefit the entire world.
On the expenditure side, we have managed to make proposals with the potential to curb expenditure in a number of areas, while on the resources side, as a previous speaker indicated – I think it was a Council representative – there will be increases ranging from about 8 to 15% in the final analysis, depending on the items, if I recall the figure that was quoted a short time ago.
When they work and serve a sector which contributes as much as tourism does to the balanced development of the regions of the Union and, in the final analysis, to European integration itself, a sector which is as susceptible and sensitive as tourism is to every sort of crisis, then these businesses, these workers, these European citizens rightly and reasonably feel that it should not be abandoned to its own fate.
The report of the Legal Affairs Committee on extraction solvents in foodstuffs, and the report on the same subject, due for debate tomorrow, of the Committee on the Environment, seek to make it incumbent on the Commission, in cases where Parliament wishes to amend the measures proposed, to submit the measures as amended by Parliament to the Council and, in the final analysis, to adopt the measures in their precisely amended form.
In the final analysis though I am personally not at all sure what the Catholic Church that emerges in the future from this fascinating time in ecclesial history we are travelling through will look like.I'm even reluctant to predict today who, or more precisely, which wing of the several that seem evident today trying to define what Catholicism is, and what its objectives are, will be left "holding the keys of the kingdom".

I am very grateful, Mr President, to the majority of members of the Committee on Agriculture and to our rapporteur, all of whom have shared my view and not looked favourably on this reduction in subsidy which would, in the final analysis, have the effect of further reducing the income of agricultural producers, already in a lamentable position in consequence of stabilizers, the effects of integrating the former GDR into the Community and so on.
Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, one might be surprised at the way in which the first few recitals of this report have been interpreted but, in the final analysis, this merely shows that everyone agrees with the evidence: the disastrous situation facing the European economy, specifically slow growth, the loss of confidence amongst investors and consumers and the increase in unemployment, to which I would add the unsustainable levels of income inequality, poverty and social exclusion.
In the final analysis, in choosing to build the 6077 at Ancona, at least for a large section of the hull and much of the outfitting work, Fincantieri adopted an effective and far-sighted strategy which, should problems arise, offered a number of alternatives that would take advantage of the integrated nature and flexibility of its yards to ensure that it would be possible to deliver the ship by the end of 2003 as required by the contract.
The Commission takes considerable pains to quantify the cost of each of its proposals by defining an overall amount covering a period of years (Memorandum of 6 March 1974 on food aid policy, proposal of 20 March 1974 on the Cheysson Fund, and Communication of 5 March 1975 on financial aid for non-associated countries).3 Although these estimates go into the greatest possible detail, the figures involved nevertheless amount, in the final analysis, to allocations of a political nature.
What the Community must do instead is to ask the Japanese to pursue a less aggressive trading policy on the European market in order to safeguard our common interest in free trade, while at the same time creating more favourable conditions for European producers to carry out the investments and restructuring operations necessary in order to restore competitiveness to our products, which is, in the final analysis, the only real source of success and stability for our industry.
But what my group believes to be of little benefit and in fact dangerous to the House is to take the backward step of restricting ourselves to this but not retaining the system that assigns to you, Mr President, in the final analysis, responsibility for negotiating this legislative programme with the Commission, in - as is our constant hope - the presence of the Council, so that what we have is a legislative programme agreed with the other Institutions.

On top of this, it is precisely these countries which will suffer most from the economic consequences of the membership of Spain and Portugal; this is borne out by the fact that these Mediterranean programmes have been discussed for years and quoted so repeatedly that we have often detected more than a hint of an argument that in the final analysis too much was being made of this issue and too much emphasis being laid on Community intervention to support these regions.
After the Troika's visit and the Commission's presence on Brioni we feel we have seen a chance of getting this message across, but we also realize that the problems and differences in Yugoslavia today are not just a recent phenomenon but have their roots in the distant past and that it is not for us to put forward solutions which, in the final analysis, must be found, chosen and specified by the Yugoslav people themselves at the end of the negotiating process.
They fear to break away from the right centrists; in the name of the struggle with “sectarianism,” they carry on a struggle against Marxism, refuse to fight for a revolutionary International and continue to remain in the Second International, at the head of which stands the king’s footman, Vandervelde. Expressing at certain moments the leftward shift of the masses, in the final analysis the centrists put a brake upon the revolutionary regrouping within the proletariat and consequently also upon the struggle against war.
In fact, since, under Article 1(3) of Annex XI to the new Staff Regulations, the pensions of former officials are adjusted using correction coefficients calculated ‘with reference to Belgium’, it cannot be ruled out that accepting the plea from that point of view could, in the final analysis, lead to a reduction in the appellant’s own pension, calculated by applying to the ‘basic’ pension, which is that paid to pensioners living in Belgium, a specific coefficient of more than 100% for the United Kingdom.
There are, however, a number of aspects in particular to which we should like to draw attention in this general assessment of the Community economy. The first can be summed up in terms of the policy guidance to avoid assessments based on size: the future of the economy no longer resides with the 'big boys'; it is in fact in 'small' and 'medium-scale' enterprise that the best opportunities for growth, development, investment and, therefore, in the final analysis, new jobs, are to be found.
There is interesting information, for example, about the speed with which knowledge becomes obsolete and about modifications in organization. But in the final analysis I feel that the whole thing is viewed too much as an automatic process and that too few critical questions are asked, for example, about the driving back of the hierarchy and the broadening of organization and the repercussions of that with regard to the decline of the less skilled and less specialized work of which we in Europe have a tremendous need.
Only a few weeks ago, Mr Barroso, the President of the Commission - and even though a President of the Commission may be a high official, he is, in the final analysis, only a purely politically elected official - told the Dutch people in their own country that they should now move on and accept this European Constitution, which, despite the rejection and democratic referendum in two Member States and despite the fact that quite a few other Member States do not even dare organise a referendum on this topic, is gradually being implemented anyway.
Those who call themselves friends of Israel to justify the impunity and unlimited accommodation shown towards its current ruling class should reflect on these words from the great Israeli writer David Grossman, whom I wish to quote: 'Amidst the wave of nationalist hyperbole now sweeping the nation, it would not hurt to recall that in the final analysis, this last operation in Gaza is just another stop along a trail blazing with fire, violence and hatred. A trail marked at times by victory, at other times by defeat, but which is leading us inevitably to ruin'.
I would also like to emphasise that, where a regulatory authority uses a bottomup theoretical model in place of the statements of depreciation and interest which the notified operator has to bear in relation to its — largely depreciated and still usable — local network, this will encourage that operator to make a strategic selection of the cost statements to be submitted to the regulatory authority, with the result that, the charges will, in the final analysis, be approved either on the basis of actual costs or on the basis of efficient costs, depending on which figure is higher.
If the serious attacks on Italian democracy over the years have not been successful in the final analysis, if— as in the case of the massacre at Christmas — the popular response has been immediate and prompt, and if the achievement of major successes in combating the terrorism of the Red Brigades has been possible, it is undoubtedly due to the people's extraordinary strength and to their commitment to democracy, enabling them to recognize the crazy intentions underlying these criminal acts and causing them to give their backing to the judiciary and police, whose commitment, sometimes at the risk of their lives, has produced these successes.
On the other hand, in a neighbouring country with a national health service which provides the sick person with a medical consultation and medicines3 free of charge, the reasoning adopted is as follows: since the doctor is remunerated and the medicines are purchased by a general government department, the latter becomes the consumer of the goods and the service, the cost of which then comes under the aggregate 'general government consumption': at the same time, these general government departments set themselves up as producers of 'health services' which in the final analysis accrue to the sick person but which, since they are 'non-market' services, cannot be regardedas 'socialbenefits'.
In particular, these objectives are as follows; to increase the availability of alternative energy sources so as to ensure the reduction of the present dependence on oil and nuclear energy; to assist the formation of a trade dynamic that, by stimulating competition, will reduce production and transports costs and, in the final analysis, the end cost, paid at the time of consumption by both large and small consumers; to guarantee certainty of supplies, through cogent regulations adopted by Member States so that the transport undertakings, joining up with one another, do not withdraw into an oligopoly, and do not put refusals or obstacles in the way of competition; and finally, to reduce the index of atmospheric pollution drastically, as a result of the better qualities possessed by the energy source.
In this case, a Dutch transport firm, Van Gend & Loos, brought an action in a Dutch court against the Dutch customs authorities, who had charged increased customs duties on a chemical product imported from the Federal Republic of Germany. The firm regarded this practice as an infringement of Article 12 EEC, which pro hibited the Member States from introducing new customs duties or increasing those that they already applied in the common market. In the final analysis, the outcome of these proceedings depended on the question whether individuals, also, can rely on Article 12 against customs duties levied in breach of the Treaty. As the answer to this question necessitated an interpretation of the EEC Treaty, the Dutch court suspended the pro ceedings and referred the matter to the Court of Justice of the European Communities. Despite the advice of numerous govern ments and its Advocate-General, the Court decided that all the rules of the founding treaties, which are worded unconditionally, are self-sufficient and legally complete so that their implementation or validity do not require any further intervention by the Member States or the Commission, can ap ply directly to individuals. This was stated to Freedom of movement means the right of all workers in the Member States of the Com munity to take up employment in any other Member State under the same conditions as national workers (Article 48(2) EEC).
