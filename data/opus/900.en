Now I can't make a move against that backwoods, white trash Sheriff Clark 'cause that'll be seen as I'm helping King. But somebody got to get Jim Clark under control.

Who make a move to go down into Egypt, without authority from me; who are looking to the strength of Pharaoh for help, and whose hope is in the shade of Egypt.
2 Who make a move to go down into Egypt, without authority from me; who are looking to the strength of Pharaoh for help, and whose hope is in the shade of Egypt.
And if you just imagine that all of these people in these towns would be watching, then I think that we can actually really make a movement towards people understanding each other better.

In a letter to George Clark and contacts, July 11, 1966, I wrote some predictions, then added: The Si's are near this area, and are about to make a move that will bring them to public notice again, just in case people are forgetting them.
We have to make a move with our own proposals and policies, which can be summed up in the following formula: alliance with our allies, friendship with the other European powers, and cooperation with everyone, particularly the Third World — but, make a move we must.
For all too long, our citizens have been waiting for us, the politicians, to make a move; for our part, these minor disciplines will allow us thoroughly to rebuild our image as upright politicians, an image all too often tarnished by corrupt or illintentioned colleagues in this Parliament or other institutions.
Calm and gentle Ghoub is in charge of checking in the injured to the Emergency Room of the Rescue Hospital. This veritable force of nature has the ability to stay calm and understanding in any situation, but be warned, if you make a move on his sandwich, you’ve only got yourself to blame…
So, any bad person may go and commit his wrongful acts and go around stirring up trouble, but whatever he achieves is sure to lend assistance to Dafa disciples in their salvation of people. (Applause) That wasn't his original intent or what those bad people wanted, but as soon as they make a move, that's inevitably the effect it has.
As has been pointed out here on several occasions, it is the aim of this House — not a lament, Mrs von Alemann, but a fact determined by the Committee on Transport, to which we both belong — to get the Council to make a move and to take up those proposals, which the railway undertakings worked out back in 1974.
We are calling on you urgently to ensure that the Council finally begins to work with us to put in place legislation so that we in Europe are able to act and no longer have to wait for ever for the Council to make a move. We need to have the tools at our disposal in Europe to enable us to make progress.
Other ones are being encouraged to go into what's called the "New Age" movement, where they wiggle pendulums before they can make a move or even go to the bathroom, or they'll play with tarot cards or various other things to try and give them a feeling that everything is preordained, and if you just do it the right way, you'll get the right preordination and you'll get the good one not the bad one.
At the beginning of the game four seeds are placed in each house. Players take turns moving the seeds. In each turn, a player chooses one of the six houses under his or her control. The player removes all seeds from this house, and distributes them, dropping one in each house counter-clockwise from the original house, in a process called sowing. Seeds are not distributed into the end scoring houses, nor into the house drawn from. That is, the starting house is left empty; if it contained 12 seeds, it is skipped, and the twelfth seed is placed in the next house. After a turn, if the last seed was placed into an opponent's house and brought its total to two or three, all the seeds in that house are captured and placed in the player's scoring house (or set aside if the board has no scoring houses). If the previous-to-last seed also brought the total seeds in an opponent's house to two or three, these are captured as well, and so on. However, if a move would capture all an opponent's seeds, the capture is forfeited, and the seeds are instead left on the board, since this would prevent the opponent from continuing the game. The proscription against capturing all an opponent's seeds is related to a more general idea, that one ought to make a move that allows the opponent to continue playing. If an opponent's houses are all empty, the current player must make a move that gives the opponent seeds. If no such move is possible, the current player captures all seeds in his/her own territory, ending the game. (Source Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owaregt;)
