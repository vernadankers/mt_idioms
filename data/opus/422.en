They believed that "all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23, 24) and that salvation is only through Christ, "who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree" (1 Peter 2:24), "for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved" (Acts 4:12).
We have done this in the past and we will continue to do it in the future, in which regard I would also like to point out to you that in this matter the situation is very different, that is in no way do the majority of the accession candidates fall short of the standard of the Member States.
How does the all-powerful Supreme Personality engage His expansions, how does He involve Himself with them, what are His actions then and what causes He to be done [see also canto 1, chapter 3]? (8) Even the scholars, in spite of endeavoring for His sake, fall short in explaining the wonderful, inconceivable acts of the Supreme Lord, dear brahmin.
(') If several product analyses are carried out on one cast, and the contents of an individual element determined lie outside the permissible range of the chemical composition as specified for the cast analysis, then it is only allowed to exceed the permissible maximum value or to fall short of the permissible minimum value, but not both for one cast.
Although You, personally, by the abundance of Your causeless mercy and glory desiring to lay open the spiritual path [called apavarga], have come here and are presently seen like one can see any ordinary person, do we fall short in our worship for You for we, o Lord of lords, are as fools ignorant about that ultimate welfare of You.
God is willing to forget the sins of His saints: “I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more” (Hebrews 8:12), “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus” (Romans 3:23, 24).
Although You, personally, by the abundance of Your causeless mercy and glory desiring to lay open the spiritual path [called apavarga], have come here and are presently seen like one can see any ordinary person, do we fall short in our worship for You as we, o Lord of lords, are as fools ignorant about that ultimate welfare of You. (Vedabase)
Moreover, with regard to the guidelines adopted by the Commission and the Council, it is clear that there will be a repeat of what happened in 2007 and 2008, namely, that spending will once again fall short of the limits laid down in the multi-annual financial framework, already insufficient to meet the needs of real social cohesion in the European Union.
The Community will make an effort to increase the amounts provided for in the financial protocols to the agreements so that they at least take account of inflation (although they will still fall short of what the Commission says is needed), but the nature of economic cooperation must also change, in order to facilitate greater coordination between public and private finance.
3.3.1 The EESC calls on the Moldovan authorities to take on board the conclusions of the international observers (a 100-strong team from the OSCE) that scrutinised the June 2007 local elections, with a view to addressing all of the areas that fall short of EU standards on democratic elections and to ensuring that the 2009 parliamentary elections are as democratic as possible.
Granted, we are all imperfect and fall short every day, but, as mentioned in the very next letter in the Bible, at 1 John 1: 7: “If we are walking in the light as he [God] himself is in the light, we do have a sharing with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. ”
The Community's strategy has been in place since 1985 with the adoption of an integrated approach to the macroeconomic and microeconomic aspects and the social dimension of this fundamental problem (moderate real wage increases that fall short of productivity growth; greater market adaptability; and a strengthening of domestic demand through an increase in private and public investment and the promotion of venture capital).
With a view to ensuring transparency, and to deter those who already fall short of the relevant safety standards, European port State control rules have, since the most recent amendments to them, which were adopted in 2001 and entered into force in July 2003, required the Commission to publish the list of ships which have been refused access to EU ports (Annex I).
O you who believe! do not take for intimate friends from among others than your own people; they do not fall short of inflicting loss upon you; they love what distresses you; vehement hatred has already appeared from out of their mouths, and what their breasts conceal is greater still; indeed, We have made the communications clear to you, if you will understand.
on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. - (PT) Mr President, we feel that the problem with the measures decided by the Council is that they are overdue, that they will have a limited impact and that they fall short of what is needed in a sector that has a good future ahead of it and that is very important to Portugal and the EU.
As far as investment in health is concerned, the committee underlines that the Monterrey commitments fall short of the funds needed to meet the targets of reducing world poverty, of which women and children are particular victims, by 50% by 2015. The draft resolution states that according to the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, an additional $31bn of aid financing to the health sector is required.
I therefore urge our rapporteur and friend, Mr Galeote Quecedo, to perhaps incorporate some of the amendments that have been tabled and to ensure that a process is initiated, that an appeal is made to the Council and that, for once, our Parliament does not fall short of the position of the Council and the Commission, as unfortunately has been the case for the last ten years.
Whereas grain whisky is described in Article 17 of Regulation (EEC) No 1842/81 as whisky made from 15 % barley or an equivalent quantity of malt and 85 % cereals; whereas, although these quantities are on the whole probable, they exceed or fall short of those actually used in each distillery; whereas it is appropriate, therefore, to delete from the said Article 17 all reference to those quantities;
But this divine and peace bestowing knowledge, as in the case of the natural scientist, is not gained for one's self alone; for if this were so, the aim of evolution would be frustrated, and it is not in the nature of things to fall short of ripening and accomplishment; and, indeed, he who thought to gain this knowledge solely for his own happiness would most surely fail.
Sesimbra and the Algarve, with provisions even so for reductions, albeit limited, in the fishing fleet throughout the period during which the,agreement will be in force, without imposing excessive conditions on discharge or acceptance . of Moroccan fishermen. On the whole, these guidelines are in keeping with the proposals which we defended through­out, in terms of this agreement, even though they really fall short of what is necessary.
If they take on a task other than the one they have been given, they will fall short in two ways: In the first place, they will not be able to fulfill the task they have taken on themselves, since their work will not be blessed by Jehovah. And in the second place, they will neglect the work that they should have been doing and thereby prove to be false Christians.
This report is a first step, albeit a cautious one, but nevertheless quite necessary to regulate the road transport sector, in which the unfettered exploitation of both salaried and self-employed drivers is the norm and in which, just as in maritime transport, there is a real culture of complacency, with businesses registered outside the European Union, and fleets of trucks and equipment that fall short of all standards and conventions of employment law.
This provision the Bible shows to be the sacrifice of God’s only - begotten Son: “For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and it is as a free gift that they are being declared righteous by his undeserved kindness through the release by the ransom paid by Christ Jesus.... that he might be righteous even when declaring righteous the man that has faith in Jesus. ” — Rom.
Be cause, as was mentioned a short time ago, nobody can claim that there is real equality between men and women, especially as far as work opportunities are concerned, either in the countries of the European Union or, more generally, in the countries of the western world: all those countries we regard as particularly civilized but which in reality fall short on basic issues of civilization, such as equal opportunities for men and women.
Member States may, on a voluntary basis, submit to the URDP annual data on their national contributions to the Union target or any benchmark set for monitoring progress in Regulation (EU) 2018/1999, including the amount by which they expect to fall short of or exceed their contribution, and an indication of the price at which they would accept to transfer any excess production of energy from renewable sources from or to another Member State.
To sin is simply to fall short of the mark, as an arrow that does not quite hit the bull's-eye.The glory of God that we fall short of is found only in Jesus Christ: "For it is the God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ" (2 Corinthians 4:6).
I also believe it is important not to restrict the information and awareness campaign on this code to the social partners and large firms, but there should be maximum effort to publicize it amongst those women - and they represent the majority - who are employed in small and very small work places, women who are not in unions and are often forced into really casual work and precarious contractual conditions, which barely fall short of exploitation.
We are, however, aware that these results fall short of the expectations of our people who know full well how difficult the domestic and international economic situation of the recent past has been, and who well understand that their rebirth, which began with the Intellectual Reform Movement at the end of the last century, has been supported and sustained neither by an industrial revolution nor by the revenues from economic growth, but rather emerged from the shadows of the Middle Ages only to confront colonial hegemony.
This Directive does not preclude that during the consultations which should take place before assistance is provided, the assisting Member State and the unrepresented citizen's Member State of nationality, whenever appropriate, agree on the possibility to extend assistance to third-country family members of the unrepresented Union citizen beyond what is required by the law of the assisting Member State or what is dictated by its practice, taking into account as much as possible requests from the unrepresented citizen's Member State of nationality, and in so far as what is agreed does not fall short of what is required by Union law.
Notice the progression in Romans 5:12: sin entered the world through Adam, death follows sin, death comes to all people, all people sin because they inherit sin from Adam. Because “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (Romans 3:23), we need a perfect, sinless sacrifice to wash away our sin, something we are powerless to do on our own. Thankfully, Jesus Christ is the Savior from sin! Our sin has been crucified on the cross of Jesus, and now “in Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace” (Ephesians 1:7).
Where a Community national holding a medical qualification which has been awarded in a Member State and is listed in Directive 93/16, but does not attest to training acquired entirely in accordance with Article 23 thereof, applies for authorisation to practise medicine in another Member State, the competent authorities of the latter must take into consideration all the diplomas, certificates, other evidence of formal qualifications and relevant experience of the person concerned, by comparing the knowledge and abilities thereby evidenced with those required by the national rules, and may not refuse authorisation unless they fall short of those requirements and the applicant cannot show that he has acquired the knowledge and abilities not attested to.'

The commitment appropriations entered in Items 7720 to 7724, with token entries for ?. new Community action in favour of a European industrial area, interest rebates on investments, aids for cooperation between industrial enterprises, finance for technological innovation, aids for exports and standardization — these are excellent things, even if they still fall short of establishing a framework of industrial policies. That will require much further work, and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is preparing to undertake it when, in the coming months, we shall be discussing alternative strategies for certain industrial sectors — strategies that should save them from the fate of the steel industry, which' was caught by major develop ments completely unprepared, and paid a heavy price.
(20) Whereas under the price and income support arrangements provided for in this Regulation, the existing public intervention in the form of buying-in by intervention agencies and public storage is no longer indispensable to balance the market but would cause considerable expenditure; whereas it should, therefore, be phased out gradually; whereas, however, in order to contribute to stabilising the market prices around the basic price which represents the desired market support level aid for private storage should be provided for; whereas, to that end, the Commission should be authorised to decide the grant of private storage aid when the market price falls below 103 % of the basic price; whereas, moreover, a "safety net" intervention scheme should be established with a view to support the beef and veal market in Member States or regions of Member States where market prices fall short of a critical price level; whereas provision should be made for the private storage aid and the intervention scheme to be implemented on the basis of the grading scale laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 1208/81 of 28 April 1981 determining the Community scale for the classification of carcases of adult bovine animals(7);
