Plumb contributor to the tune of 1 150 million units of account even after the proposed rebate is taken into account. So can it be that Parliament believes that the United Kingdom is solely responsible for the post ponement of a decision on the enlarging of own resources ?
We are, however, opposed to the establishment of additional independent institutions, the ultimate result of which will be the existence of new and expensive bureaucracies, and, since the financial issues have been left quite unresolved, reject the planned unspecified financial obligations to the tune of some EUR 52 million.
The European Community imports vegetable fats to the tune of six times the volume of its butter stocks, 45% of these imports being from the United States : 90 000 tonnes of butter are imported from New Zealand exclusively into the United Kingdom, where butter consumption is steadily declining.

I am even more appalled at certain politicians who have jumped on the bandwagon, including, I am ashamed to say, the British Conservative Party, which said it supported enlargement, has never raised this issue in the past and then started to dance to the tune of its tabloid masters.
Should be mixed 1 to 2 macerate drops of vegetable oil to a mother (bio !) or the cétoline (pharmacy.) You then apply either to the tune of the organ to be treated (percutaneous pelvic) is preferably of the "reflex zone" legs, hand or ear that matches the bodies referred.

1.19 The aid granted to Greece will help safeguard the international financial system which has guaranteed Greece's debt to the tune of hundreds of billions of euro, and placed its trust in the world's largest commercial bank, which concealed major borrowings so that they did not show up in Greece's public accounts.
Rübig (PPE). — (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I should like to ask the Commission why tobacco growing is still being supported to the tune of one billion euros, and in particular why lower-quality tobacco is supported rather than the high-quality varieties which are less damaging to health.
1.19 The aid granted to Greece will help safeguard the international financial system which has guaranteed Greece's debt to the tune of hundreds of billions of euro, and placed its trust in the world's largest commercial bank, which concealed major borrowings so that they did not show up in Greece's public accounts.

Caroline LUCAS (Greens/EFA, South East) on the other hand, was concerned about the impact on the 400 million small-scale farmers in rural China, who, she said, were likely to lose out as a result of an agreement which would benefit US grain exporters to the tune of $2bn over the next five years.
Thirteen teenagers seated in neatly lined-up chairs start roughhousing to the tune of the Velvet Underground – an explosion of unbridled energy, but carefully choreo-graphed, as they repeat exactly the same scene over and over again, in different moods and styles, to rebellious music of all ages, exploring every aspect of teenage life.
She and Lotje Schoots (NED) changed places in this competition — the young Dutch girl won the Young Rider event yesterday and was runner-up today.

Even though lower car insurance quotes are occurring through competition from warring insurance companies vying for new business, as well as increasing online quote houses, millions of consumers are still paying dramatically more for their car insurance than they have to, to the tune of millions every year, and hundreds of dollars per household.
While we are on this subject, I should also like to mention that the TACIS action programme for social and economic reconstruction in the Northern Caucasus, which is funded by the EU to the tune of EUR 20 million, has now become operational, and it offers the prospect of positive developments being brought about.
It would seem, in fact, that many firms are using their profits mainly to pay off accumulated debts.

Secondly, would Commissioner Sutherland make a statement on the situation that has arisen in the United Kingdom, where the British Govern ment has subsidized Aerospace to the tune of UKL 1 billion by selling them the Royal Ordnance factories at a knockdown price and allowing them to asset-strip in order to get this kind of cash?
Therefore, the Group set aside a provision for 21% of this amount as well as for the corresponding effect on the portfolio of insurance businesses, or a total of 534 million euros. Furthermore, certain minority interests consolidated under the equity method in the insurance sector had a negative impact to the tune of 26 million euros.
The result of this is that there, too, the environment is also burdened to the tune of EUR 300 million a year, and that is without mentioning the waste of energy that these cheap chargers cause, as they are often left in the socket even after the phone itself has been disconnected, where they continue to consume energy.
The Commission has decided not to raise any objections to the grant­ing of regional aid in the form of subsidies to the tune of ESP 111 million (ECU 6.65 million) to enable Fabricación de automóviles Renault de España (FASA) to invest in its Valladolid plant with a view to increasing capacity for the pro­duction of the new Clio.
The Commission considers that the exemption from corporation tax in the amount of FRF 5882849762 relating to the reclassification as a capital contribution, provided for by Act No 97-1026, of accounting provisions for the renewal of the high-voltage transmission network, already implemented to the tune of FRF 14119065335, constitutes aid that is illegal and incompatible with the internal market.
While the centre right and centre left governments of its Member States refuse to satisfy even the smallest wage or other claims of workers on the grounds that the economy cannot support them, the European Council is insultingly funding the banks and monopolies to the tune of trillions of euros, again forcing workers to bear the cost of the crisis.
As you know, at the end of 1990 the Commission set up a programme of emergency humanitarian aid to the tune of about ECU 4.5 million, with the aim of installing adequate heating systems in all Romanian orphanages, and of providing them with food and medicine, and with training in those centres housing disabled and undernourished children in extremely difficult circumstances.

As far as the one-point increase in the depreciation coefficient was concerned, the advantage was, it was claimed, offset by the fact that any losses posted were deductible, under Article 39 CA of the General Tax Code, only to the tune of one quarter of the profits subject to ordinary corporation tax which each member of the EIG earned from its activities.
The Commission's proposal hides a large dose of confusion as tobacco consumption (which is a major source oftax revenue for the Member States — to the tune of EUR 63 000 million) cannot and must not be tackled by plunging European producers into crisis, most of whom live in lessfavoured rural areas and receive only EUR 955 million of the Community budget.
Some sections of the media have said that Mr Francisco Fernández Ordonez, during his recent visit to the United States to meet President Bush in his capacity as President-in-Office of the EC Council of Ministers, described the US administration's decision to continue aid to the Contras to the tune of US$ 50 million, thus enabling them to remain in Honduras, as 'acceptable'.
< < For the Chief Musician. To the tune of "The Lily of the Covenant." A teaching poem by David, when he fought with Aram Naharaim and with Aram Zobah, and Joab returned, and killed twelve thousand of Edom in the Valley of Salt. > > God, you have rejected us. You have broken us down. You have been angry. Restore us, again.
At the same time, under the pretext of an alleged increase in workload due to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and of Parliament's supposed concern about the quality of its legislative texts, the MEPs are awarding themselves a 'small' budget increase to the tune of a few million euros so that staff can be recruited for the political groups!
Some 17 projects co-financed to the tune of EUR 11.9 million relate to the theme ofminimising the impact of economic activities, which covers clean technologies andthe reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.Finally, EUR 7.5 million has been allocatedto 11 projects which deal with the theme ofpromoting the integration of environmentalconsiderations, whether in the urban environment, in coastal zone management,tourism or other areas of landuse development and planning.
We really are not looking at this problem from a purely national point of view, and we cannot fail to condemn the Community's stance, which, after only a few months, is not honouring its commitments to the two new countries of the Community, expecting them to become net contributors, to the tune of approximately 730 million ECU — simply throwing its commitments into the rubbish bin.
I believe the Commissioner will be able to confirm that the building was bought for USD 0.5 million, refurbished to the tune of USD 2.2 million - that is four times what it was bought for - whilst renting somewhere else for about USD 18 000 per month which was cheaper than where the Commission's residence was beforehand because I believe it was in the Four Seasons Hotel.
I am thinking of my own country which, precisely because the European Union would not give political support if it were to be faced with a threat of war, is now having to embark on an armaments programme to the tune of ECU 10 billion, which will totally negate all of the efforts of recent years to achieve convergence with a view to joining the EMS and the EMU.
And in the case of Spain, I hope that the Commission will make a positive proposal for a decision, given that the aid/closures ratio envisaged in the dossier on the steel industry as a whole is more than acceptable, with a 2.3 million tonne reduction in capacity and aid to the tune of about 438 000 million pesetas, and that it makes Spain's steel industry as a whole predominantly privately owned.
Thus the contributions made by MEPs, added to the proposals accepted by the Council at first reading, such as taking into account the particularly dramatic situation of Somalia, will, I believe, all help to produce a very satisfactory regulation, provided that we are able to allocate a budget to the tune of approximately ECU 500 million for more than ten years, depending on how the ACP countries and the market develop.
And I would like to put it to Mr Patijn that there is need for strong political direction from the Council of Ministers to the Commission, bearing in mind that there is unemployment to the tune of about 20 million in the European Union, which must surely rank as a number one political priority of the Union which has to be addressed in terms of planning for the period after 1999.
On the basis of the Ambition 2005 plan, about which the majority shareholder was kept regularly informed, and of the banking syndicate's commitment, the State announced, on 4 December 2002, its decision to participate in the strengthening of the Company's capital base to the tune of EUR 9 billion and the fact that it was prepared to place at France Télécom's disposal, through ERAP, an advance on this subscription remunerated at market rates.
As the Commissioner responsible for the budget, I am completely behind the emergency action which needs to be decided, including support for the beef market, but the fact that we subsidise beef production to the tune of EUR 6 billion on the one hand and must now pay out thousands of millions to subsidise its destruction is proof positive, in my opinion, of the urgent need for action in the whole agricultural policy sector.
Pursuant to Article 39 CA of the General Tax Code, losses from groupings’ financial years the results of which are affected by depreciation charges entered in the accounts on the score of the first 12 months of the asset's depreciation are deductible to the tune of no more than one quarter of the profits taxable at the normal rate of corporation tax which each member of the EIG earns from the rest of its activities.

As regards noncompulsory expenditure, I have no hesitation in saying that in many areas this has been decimated. Where consumer and environmental policy is concerned there has been a reduction of 29% over 1984, in the technology and innovation sector there have been reductions of between 40 and 60%, in the food aid sector there have been reductions of 27%, and inflation of course has to be added to this to the tune of a good 5%.
On 3 March the Commission decided to close with a negative decision the proceedings it had initiated underArticle 88(2) of the ECTreaty in respect of an aid scheme set up for firms affected by the bankruptcy of SIR-AP SpA: suppliers, creditors and firms having carried out work on its behalf.The aid, which had been granted in the form of state guarantees and interest subsidies to the tune of EUR1.03million (ITL2000million),constituted operating aid incompatible with the common market.
July 1994 (') authorising the recapitalisation of Air France to the tune of ECU 3.05 billion (FRF 20 billion), owing to insufficient reasoning on two points, one relating to the purchase of new aircraft and the other to the competitive position of Air France on routes outside the European Economic Area, the Commission decided on 22 July to adopt a new decision authorising the same amount and clarifying its position regarding the two points raised by the Court.
In the EESC's view, while this proposal is in line with sustainable development and health policies, it hides a large dose of confusion as tobacco consumption (which is a major source of tax revenue for the Member States – to the tune of €63,000 million) cannot and must not be tackled in the short term by plunging European producers into crisis, most of whom live in less-favoured rural areas and receive only €955 million of the Community budget.
- a capital increase launched on the market and guaranteed to the tune of EUR 33 million by a group of investors: NEC and France Télécom (Bull's historical shareholders) for EUR 7,5 million each, Debeka (a German insurance company and one of Bull's major customers) for EUR 3 million, the investment funds Axa Private Equity and Artemis for EUR 7 million and EUR 2 million respectively and, lastly, 350 senior managers of the Bull group for EUR 6 million.
All the banks had very clear signals from the authorities in the Republic of Ireland regarding the government's position on this matter when in January 1989 the then Fianna Fail administration decided to cancel any future credits for exports of beef to Iraq, and when in October 1989 the current Minister for Industry and Commerce, Desmond O'Malley, investigating within his own department allegations relating to exports to Iraq, chose to withdraw retrospectively credits to the tune of almost £60 million.
We all know that regional policy supported tourism-incentive projects during the 1994-99 period to the tune of ECU 9 billion, but this cannot be used to justify the absence of a Community action plan for tourism, because there are areas in which potential exists for Community added value, with external promotion outside the European Union, reduction of seasonal variations, coordination of the activities of different programmes and policies where they affect tourism, fiscal harmonisation, classification of tourism structures, safety and information for tourists as consumers.
Table 3 below represents the total amount of the cumulative payment in three scenarios: (a) Scenario 1: HSH’s base case, which assumes that the guarantee will not be drawn and will be fully cancelled by HSH by the end of 2015; (b) Scenario 2: an intermediate scenario, which assumes a drawing of the guarantee to the tune of EUR 5 billion; and (c) Scenario 3: the underlying case of the assets’ valuation, which assumes that the guarantee will be fully drawn by [2015-2020] (no cancellations).
a capital increase launched on the market and guaranteed to the tune of EUR 33 million by a group of investors: NEC and France Télécom (Bull's historical shareholders) for EUR 7,5 million each, Debeka (a German insurance company and one of Bull's major customers) for EUR 3 million, the investment funds Axa Private Equity and Artemis for EUR 7 million and EUR 2 million respectively and, lastly, 350 senior managers of the Bull group for EUR 6 million. In reality, the public has contributed EUR 13,8 million.
Correia (PSE), in writing. - (PT) The Cohesion Fund was set up in order to reinforce economic and social cohesion,' such that the European Union would fund, to the tune of 80 to 85 %, any projects in the field of the environment and infrastructure works in the sector of transport in the transEuropean networks, aimed at the less developed Member States including Portugal, with the ultimate objective that all Member States should be able to participate in the final phase of European economic and monetary union.
The schooling helped our opponents, but it is still more profitable for us for them all to call -- to the tune of about $11.50 a hand. (65 wins of $260 = $16,900. 35 losses of $50 = $1750. Total profit = $15,150, or $1150 more than the $14,000. Also note that the 35 times we lose, we lose the $20 we invested in the pot to that point, or $700. However, that is not what we are analyzing here. We are looking at our situation on the turn.
In the short-term we must struggle to secure today's energy requirements, and here I think that a purely national policy predominates because each government, under the pressure of every day needs, often in a state of panic and almost always hard pressed by public opinion, hastens to obtain petrol for its country by always giving something more and something else to the oil-producing countries, and there is no doubt that in doing so they are dancing to the tune of the producers at the expense of all of us.
2.10.4 In JAPAN, the seventh largest market for EU exports, with EUR 36 billion of exports as against EUR 56.7 of imports in 2009 – EU companies have difficulty gaining access to public contracts, despite the fact that Japan is a signatory to the WTO GPA: only 4% of all public contracts were opened to EU companies, worth EUR 22 billion (2007), that is less than 0.7% of Japanese GDP, while Japan had access to the EU public market to the tune of EUR 312 billion, i.e. 2.5% of EU GDP9.
At the same time the French Government's Minister for Economic Affairs — you will forgive me if I go on about this, but I do represent France in this Assembly and if I cannot voice my views in the National Assembly I can do so here — said that a grant of 750 million had been made for transport in Corsica and that this money had been misappropriated. He said that there had been tax rebates to employees to the tune of 550 million and that these too had been misappropriated.
In this respect, the Commission takes a positive view of the commitment given by Portugal that the core tier 1 capital ratio of BPN at the date of the sale to Banco BIC will not be higher than [10-18] % and that if non-performing loans are transferred to the State or any entity controlled by the State after the sale, Banco BIC or the combined entity will transfer to the State or any entity controlled by the State any capital associated with those loans to the tune of [10-18] % of the loans’ risk weighted assets.
The Commission notes Portugal's commitment in this respect that if Banco BIC or the combined entity chooses to return loans to the State or any entity controlled by the State after the sale, it will pay back to the State the capital associated with those loans to the tune of [10-18] % of the loans’ risk weighted assets and will, in addition, transfer non-performing loans and pay back the capital associated with those loans to the State only after having completely exhausted the provisions available at the date of the sale in the accounts of BPN.
Share-capital companies, sports-club factories, from Manchester United to AC Milan, not to mention the US basketball and golf circuits, doping, the industry of anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs, which have left Pankov' s Germany and the Soviet Union to spread throughout the world, Adidas, Nike and other sponsors who want to see results, transfers to the tune of dollars beyond our wildest dreams, the EU Court of Justice' s judgments, including the famous 1995 Bosman judgment that everyone criticised but that ensures the free movement of young sportsmen and women and sports merchandise, the huge commercialisation, the alleged re-broadcasting rights and the collusion between sport and business - that is the real face of the industrialised world of sport that comes under our Community legislation.
