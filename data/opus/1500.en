If you are of the opinion that we are airing your opinions to an insufficient extent, then perhaps you have a more reliable element, consisting of burdening your President with the task of bringing across your views to the European Council where he is always the first person to take the floor, and I can assure you that his words are most attentively listened to.
(5) The detailed arrangements for the representation of the European Union on KEDO's Executive Board must be settled. In that connection, the Council and the Commission have agreed that if KEDO's Executive Board was to address any matter falling outside Euratom's competence, it is the Presidency of the Council of the European Union which should take the floor to express a position on such matters.
Mr President, I had asked to take the floor before Mr McDowell spoke on the Council’s behalf, as I would like to ask him to clarify his position with regard to a prominent subject in today’s debate, namely the idea that the next parliamentary term should also be opened with a Tampere II, and, accordingly, with a reaction, a counterbalance on the part of the Council.
Should I be criticised over human rights in the future, there will be no need for Mr Barón Crespo or Mr Seguro to take the floor because Mr Wim van Velzen will be the first to rise in this House. I repeat - he does not need to apologise - next time, he will be the one to defend me against any totally unfounded accusations or criticism.
Mr President, I too take the floor to speak on behalf of the PPE Group on this extremely important Commission proposal which, as has already been said, is part of a broader package of measures designed to set in train a process of fiscal coordination among the Member States in all those areas in which excessive fiscal competition is very clearly having negative effects that must be countered.
Since I was unable to take the floor at the vote last week in Strasbourg, I should like to reiterate that it is important to separate the programmes for consumer protection and health from each other, even if the Commission did not give this a particularly positive assessment, because, ultimately, the two programmes have different legal bases, and hence consumer protection needs to be afforded in a different way.
As joint draftsman of an opinion on behalf of the Committee on Fundamental Freedoms and an opinion on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I am one of the few members of the committees required to give an opinion who has been able to take the floor in this debate and I do so in order to voice my criticism of our in-house procedure.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since changes within our group make this the last partsession at which I am able to take the floor as a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, I should like to use the opportunity of today's debate on the EU programme 'Towards sustainability' to raise for one last time something which is a pressing concern of the Austrian people.
It would be logical for him to take the floor first, but as often in the final days before a summit of this type, logic is overridden by the events and I must travel quickly to Bonn in order to meet someone who is playing a key role in the problem concerning us just now. That is why I welcome this generous gesture and I am very grateful to it.
Mr Farage, you will take the floor, but first of all I would like to make it very clear that, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, your request is late, for two reasons at least: because it has not been presented within the time limits laid down and because the request for an oral question to the Commission has not been presented within the time limits laid down either.
Mr President, I wanted to take the floor because, today, in the relative confusion of the votes, partly due to the fact that we were voting on important issues, the European Parliament has given, given back or, to be more accurate, has agreed to give EUR 12 billion - to be exact, EUR 11.6 billion - back to the Member States because it was left over from the budget for 2000.
I urgently requested that this issue be discussed in plenary once more, not only because it concerns thousands of workers in my back yard, Antwerp in Flanders - you will see that many Members of the European Parliament will take the floor on this issue - but also, in particular, because it concerns a pan-European restructuring operation involving the closure of one plant and the loss of thousands of other jobs.
Mrs Leyla Zana, before you take the floor, I would like to remind the House why this Parliament awarded you the Sakharov Prize, the freedom of conscience prize, and I would also like to take this opportunity to welcome Mrs Roth and Mrs Lalumière, who are with us today and who, as leaders of their respective groups, were amongst those who proposed that you receive this prize, almost ten years ago.
Mr President-in-Office, as I have the fortune to take the floor at the end of this debate, I should first of all like to express my satisfaction as an Italian at the recognition, shown by so many, of the historic role played by Italy in the process of European integration: a role, I may add, that has always given particular value to those original supranational institutions, the European Commission and the European Parliament.

Rübig (PPE). - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, since changes within our group make this the last partsession at which I am able to take the floor as a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Con sumer Protection, I should Uke to. use the opportunity of today's debate on the EU programme 'Towards sustainabiUty' to raise for one last time something which is a pressing concern of the Austrian people.
At the same time, I would very much like it if this debate was not an anti-Russian one, because those present in this House, those who take the floor, should be familiar with the ethnic map of Ukraine, and should know which counties were affected by this Stalinist horror, by means of which the Communist dictatorship strove to exterminate the peasantry - for the most part those who died were Ukrainians, but not exclusively Ukrainians.
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (PL) Madam President, as I take the floor on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group in the case before the World Trade Organisation regarding the complaint by Boeing against Airbus, I should like to draw attention to the fact that the bitter rivalry between the two economic and political power bases located on either side of the Atlantic has been ongoing for many years.
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, I take the floor in various capacities, not just as a coordinator for the largest political group here in Parliament, but also as someone who played a leading role in discussing this dossier during the previous mandate and, above all, as somebody who, in a previous business career, actually introduced works councils into several different businesses: somebody who fundamentally believes in developing information and consultation and who does know something about what works and what does not work - certainly a true champion of the philosophy.
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have also been eager to take the floor to express my thanks for the work that has been done, above all by Mr Sacconi, who has by now accumulated experience that helps him to resolve even the most difficult of cases, but also of course by the French Presidency, the Council and the Commission. Their concerted efforts have enabled us to finalise all of these climate dossiers and this one in particular regarding the automobile sector which, as many have said, raised concerns due to the current economic situation.
