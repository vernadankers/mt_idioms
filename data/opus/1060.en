Specifically for the first 18 months of its life my guess is that it will live on the nose of a missile for our own use or for sale to our allies and help guide it to its target so that innocent people won't get hurt.

Fine and elegant wine with a bouquet revealing subtle aromas of small black berries, griotte, toasted almond, notes of spices, leather and game. In the mouth we find the same elegance as on the nose, roundness, fine tannins and aromas of very ripe black fruits, mocha and game.

The embroidery is lovely, and is a rare kind of decoration, silk bows or pompoms are more common. If you look closely you can still see the blue chalk with which the pattern was drawn on the noses before they were embroidered, so these shoes have been worn very little.

Concedo nulli: ‘I yield to no one’. Watching the rolling English hills flit by my train window, I imagine a smug-looking train driver painting Erasmus’s motto on the nose of his locomotive. Erasmus takes pride in this motto – which he ‘borrows’ from the Roman god Terminus, the guardian of boundaries in Classical mythology. Erasmus prefers to expand borders rather than bow to them.

Fiona: haha! Yes, I have grown up to love slalom and waves! My dad started teaching me when I was about five. I preferred riding on the nose of his board to sailing on my own, until I was seven. My dad is really active in the local Gorge Cup race series, and when I was eleven I wanted to join him. I have been slalom racing since! I started wave sailing because my dad and I heard about the AWT. We thought it looked fun, so we went to San Carlos for a week so I could learn to sail in the waves a bit before we went to a contest.
