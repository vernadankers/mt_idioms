I should like to illustrate this by means of a second comment. The Commission did not even see fit to take on board an amendment that was already embodied in the Council provisions and thus does not come under Article 93 of the Treaty, which is being invoked by the Commission and which expressly links the level of aid with the dismantlement of the compensatory amounts.
By way of derogation from point (a) of Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 where a contribution is granted for the financing of equipment, including auxiliary motors, which significantly improves energy efficiency on board fishing vessels, including small scale coastal fishing vessels, and reduces emissions and contributes to the fight against climate change, the minimum private financial participation to that operation shall be 40 %.
During the month of September, both the full-cargo segment (+ 9.5%) and belly cargo (+ 9.0%) recorded the highest growth, while integrator services declined (-4.2%) due to a number of cancelled flights at DHL.The strong growth in cargo on board passenger aircraft is due to the new routes to Asia operated by Cathay Pacific and Hainan Airlines, and to Emirates' doubling of capacity to the Gulf region.

Then came a brunch of pancake in the cockpit and the rest of the day we spent ashore, hiking through these immense hills and flats in front of the glaciers ending higher up. Lia, Marion and Roswitha continued to close to the glacier and spotted 4 beautiful white arctic hares, while Pieter, Liesbeth and Eef returned to the dinghy and did a good firing exercise with the new rifle on board.

If all is satisfactory he can focus on the on-board implementation.Upon successful completion of the inspection, the new DMLC Part II will be endorsed by the attending inspector and a new MLC certificate will be issued.For vessels that do not require a MLC certificate but are under a 3-yearly regime of the Dutch Flag it is highly recommended that they also have the new DMLC Part I on board as well as DMLC Part II including items 15 and 16.
If the length of time for which the workers must remain without interruption on board the means of transport does not necessitate application of paragraph 1, the employer must, if the nature of the journey and the activities so require, either make available to workers sanitary facilities, rest rooms and living quarters as defined in para graph 1, or take adequate measures to ensure that workers may have the use of facilities of at least the same standard at suitable and easily accessible locations.

I should also like him to comment on the difficulty in the present state of cargo transport where much of it is containerized — this being the most profitable, most advantageous and most theft-proof method of transport — of identifying what is in the container and the way in which this can be reconciled with the stated manifest which is the document required by the Inter-Governmental Maritime Organization, to be carried by the Master of each vessel, taken on board at the beginning of his journey and given to the responsible authorities at the end of his journey.
But you will be approached and that’s not the first time I’ve been approached to do this kind of thing. You’ll find that some people are bought over. I should go back to Lord Bertrand Russell on this topic becauseLord Bertrand Russell said in one of his own books, the same book in fact where he talks about those children who manage to escape the indoctrinations – who have intelligence and an ability to communicate to others – must be brought on board the system, employed by the system, bribed into the system if possible; that generally works with most people.
