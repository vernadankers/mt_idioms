Our dogs are participating in the study of hip dysplasia by a multidisciplinary team within the Ghent University Association. The focus is primarily on the genetics, the researchers would only identify the causative mutation of laxity and the prevention of this disease in the long term reduce / disappear from the dog population.
Ideally, therefore, the National Union of Mineworkers al* In the long term is to provide a mining engineering service national1y as opposed to locally, to cover all the coalfields; locally there should be a National Union of Mineworkers mining engineer for each of the National Coal Board areas, taking geographical factors Into account.
President Delors's proposal contains some correct approaches, but we as a Parliament will have to take good care to see that we get joint decision making and reasonable financing that will be viable in the long term and will also put an end to the long-running con flict between the governments and Parliament.
This shows the common intention of the parties to strive for the complete abolition of visa requirements in the long term, in view of the impact that appropriate implementation of the objectives of facilitating and simplifying visa issuance procedures could have both on individuals and on the development of economic and trade relationships.
In the short term, there would be quite a few experiments, because we should need to use some data that we do not have at present, but, in the long term, REACH would result in far fewer experiments because of the introduction of compulsory data sharing, which is definitely also an aspect worth including.
The EESC agrees that, in the long term, in order to avoid conflicts, there are many arguments in favour of integrating all components of the EU's structural policy (including e.g. Europe 2020, cohesion policy, the CAP or the EIB) in a fully coherent set of general community policies, which could be called EU 2050.
An essential prerequisite, however, is a balanced development on a Com munity-wide scale, of the type that only common policies can secure. Otherwise, there is a risk that in the long term the market will again become fragmented, owing to the built-in mechanics of a united market which favours the most prosperous sectors and regions.
The Commission should assess and report on the feasibility of a phase out of the use of dental amalgam in the long term, and preferably by 2030, taking into account the national plans required by this Regulation and whilst fully respecting Member States' competence for the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care.
In the long term the problem can only be solved by a general restructuring of the steel industry as the Commission and, in particular, its vice-Chairman Mr Davignon have very rightly stressed time and again, whereas, in conjunction with the restructuring of the steel industry it is also essential to ensure decentralization within the Community.
There fore, it considers that a budgetary position of a limited deficit in the medium term would help avoid any risk of emerging budget imbalances in the context of an ageing population and give greater assurance to the programme view that 'the public finances, based on current policies, are sus tainable in the long term'.
It is to be welcomed that particular attention has been focused on the protection and integration of minorities, but if we are to safeguard such things in the long term we need new instruments to ensure that the EU continues to exert an influence and to have control mechanisms at its disposal in any post-accession period.
On the question of the longterm sustainability of Spain's public finances, the Council considers that, despite their soundness, measures to shore them up must be taken to complement the current policies and to anticipate the risks associated with spending forecasts in the long term and the growth of spending on pensions in the very long term.
However, the wider and more detailed talks on the future of Europe which are being conducted within the framework of the European Convention are aimed at dealing comprehensively and in the long term with the demands of enlargement, both from the point of view of institutions and as regards policies and the means to achieve them."
There is a danger that we will identify, at a financial level, the policy to develop the countryside with the common agricultural policy, and we are facing the possibility that the CAP will be assimilated and fragmented in the long term within the frameworks of other policies, such as the policy for the regions, for example.
Such variations, which are mostly attri butable to the government's or the regional authorities' social, antiinflation, industrial, regional or general energy policies, are not en tirely desirable in the long term, for they artificially change the structure of total energy consumption, introduce distortions of competition and may hinder the development of a genuine common energy market.
As I have already explained on previous occasions, we are all agreed that there is a chronic lack of competition in this sector and that it does not therefore make economic sense to hang on to the belief that EU producers can hold out against free competition with Turkish hazelnuts or American almonds in the long term.
In the long term, the Euratom Programme is to support the preparation and development of a competitive nuclear fusion industrial sector facilitating the involvement of the private sector as well as SMEs where appropriate, in particular through the implementation of a technology road map to a fusion power plant with active industrial involvement in the design and development projects.
It also tends to be inflationary: State aid puts a burden on public spending and therefore increases taxes on other sectors of the economy; it can result in a transfer of resources without any return, even in the long term; it shields firms from the impact of increased production costs, which in turn contributes to delays in modernizing plant.
In the long term, the added value of European cooperation on issues such as European networks of centres of reference; sharing assessments of new health technologies; and using information and communication technology to provide more efficient healthcare ("e-health") will help to improve the quality and efficiency of all healthcare, both for those patients who move and those who do not.
They involve enhancing the content in the long term, incorporating more material that is subject to copyright, resolving the issue of out-of-print or orphan works, finding new methods of financing, improving accessibility for disabled people, providing a fully multilingual service, all issues that are addressed shrewdly in the text that we voted on and which I, as a result, supported.
Shita tells us about a small village in the Arfak Mountains where a guide called Zeth, takes people on bird watching tours into the forests. Zeth was a poacher himself before, but now he realises that protecting the birds brings them more money in the long term than hunting the birds (see also the column: “Ecotourism in the purest form”).
Parliament will have to evaluate the projects carried out before these funds are renewed in 2013 and will have to be involved in drafting the future regulation laying down the eligibility criteria, particularly in relation to transparency, so as to ensure that every single vulnerable population actually receives these funds and is afforded a dignified existence in the long term.
The Commission considers that the underlying principles of the Dublin system are worth upholding and that, in the long term, the higher common standards of protection resulting from the completion of the CEAS will eliminate most of the concerns regarding the operation of the current system, by ensuring that persons transferred to other Member States have equal access to protection.
The main recommendation was that in the long term there should be a common EU mandatory duty on consumer service suppliers to report all serious incidents involving consumers, pointing to Member states’ responsibility towards generating national accident estimates for each tourism and leisure-related sector in a standard format to be easily collated on a European web site to create comparison tables.
Let us consider the example of the Middle East: a collective movement by all States in that region towards greater economic, cultural and political cooperation, leading in the long term to the establishment of a joint area of security, prosperity and justice, would have the effect of eliminating the threats to all concerned and hence any justification for acquiring nuclear weapons.
Moreover, thinking about the internal market, I cannot rule out the possibility that some Member States might devise, in the absence of Community standards, their own national rules, which will then certainly be stricter but will affect trade in the internal market and, in the long term, not provide a basis for the technological concept we are working on with the industry.
A European agriculture model was drawn up in the context of work previously carried out by the Council on the Agenda 2000 proposals. This model, which is to be further developed in the future, is for a multifunctional and competitive form of agriculture throughout the European Union, and also in the regions with specific problems, which is viable in the long term.
This is something I particularly appreciate because, in general, these recommendations imply that Parliament is convinced that in the absence of a European policy, a policy promoting cooperation between the regions, and of a demonstration of what Europe can do, not only in the immediate future, but to recreate hope in the long term, the present legal crisis will not be solved.
If the organization of mobility is not yet a major problem for the firm, it could, in the long term, become an issue: increase in the average age of a population which is not very mobile in an employment area in which job prospects are poor, a structure which is currently stable but which could raise problems in the case of crisis.
The theoretical justification of ‘substitutionism’ will have yet more catastrophic consequences in the long term, though Trotsky formulated this thesis in a less radical way than Lenin and did not talk of the obsolescence of class or of a permanent incapacity of the class to exercise power. He wrote: “Today we have before us a peace proposal from the government of Poland.
If these communication and education activities are not limited to the threat to biodiversity but also highlight the other dangers – to public health, to agriculture – people may become less reluctant towards new legislation and the establishment of a new European Agency, especially when it becomes clear that doing nothing will be much more expensive in the long term than acting now.
If, on the contrary, we hold fast to a rigid conception of the European Union, the only outcome, in the long term, will be the reversal of the decision made at Helsinki and the resumption of an association process with Turkey of the same kind as those we are developing with the other Mediterranean States which geography and history have placed outside Europe.
It believed that the terrorist attacks on the United States would have a considerable impact in the long term, condemned all forms of international terrorism and advocated that the members of the WTO should give a strong and clear message to the global economy at the Doha ministerial conference that multilateral cooperation on freer and fairer trade would continue. Parliament hoped that the conference
In the long term, I agree, we are going to have to come back to the beef and veal market in connection with the debate on the reform of the milk market and in addition to that we are of course, as a first step, also going to have to introduce a better labelling system and, associated with that, appropriate promotion of European meat.
It was mistaken about structural factors (Mr des Places spoke about these): the Chinese population figures, the rise in the Chinese standard of living, the climatic factor that I have already mentioned, the political factor in the collapse of the USSR, all of which mean that cereal consumption can only increase in the long term. And anybody who has made mistakes will make more!
However, in the long term open label study, the efficacy and safety of Mirvaso, as described above, was not affected by the concomitant use of cosmetics or other medicinal products (e.g. topical metronidazole, topical azelaic acid, and oral tetracyclines including low dose doxycycline) for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in the concerned subpopulation (131/449 patients in the study used concomitant rosacea medicinal product).
“This money will not be spent on research conducted at someone else’s behest. That is called commissioned research, and we have a holding company for that,” says Baele. “This is all about the donor really wishing to contribute to high quality research carried out in the long term. This is not a way for donors to get lecture rooms and libraries named after them, either.
The parliamentary report calls on the German authorities and the Community to use Community resources as seedcorn finance to help the promotion of private investment in research and development, which has collapsed largely since unification, and in the manufacturing sector so that workers can use their skills in value-added jobs and to give the new Länder a local economic base sustainable in the long term.
It is not being discussed today, but if it had been discussed today I believe it would not have done any good in the long term, because the basis of that report is, in fact, the basis of the future development of the agricultural policy itself, and if an interim report had been submitted at this stage, we would not have been able to support it.
Without in .any way disputing the importance of these objectives, the ergonomist is more interested in questions such as the optimal harmonization of man and machine (by studying human possibilities and limitations), the reduction of excessive physical of mental strain, the simplification of jobs etc., in short everything which may encourage the physical and mental well-being of men at their place of work, especially in the long term.
This forces me to do things I don’t like, such as taking breaks and doing interval training and walking exercises, but which I know deep down are good for me. I’ve also realised that I will have to sleep a few hours more and reject the odd drink every once in a while, so as to be able to run a lightning fast race in the long term.
Adopted on 27 November. In this communication, the Commission describes the progress and re sults of the negotiations with six non-member countries (Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco, San Marino, Switzerland and the United States) to wards their adoption of measures equivalent to those to be applied within the Community on the taxation of savings and consisting, in the long term, of generalised automatic exchange ofinformation between the tax authorities of the Member States.
The EU should take a number of areas into greater consideration. These include financing World Food Programme needs, work involving various organisations to assess countries' needs, aid for small farmers (in the short term, and also an analysis of food price volatility in the long term); long-term challenges in the area of production and productivity, neglected research plans, and the need to find risk management solutions (such as drought-related financial derivatives).
Culture must not be made subject to the rules of the market or to commercial law; instead, we need regulation that takes into consideration what is appropriate to each area, and so we have to find a global solution to enable Article 151(4) of our European Treaties to be the means whereby Europe's, and the world's, cultural diversity is secured and supported in the long term and in a sustainable way.
It is quite clear, though, that if people want, in the long term, to run these large motors – which are not 80 horse-power jobs, but check in at between 600 and 1000 kW, and have a correspondingly massive output – then they will have to put their hands in their pockets to do so; they must realise that they will have to do that in future, and they must make preparations.
Apart from the contribution of information, the fact that the various authorities responsible for individual aspects of the environment are associated with the assessment procedures may in the long term stimulate coordination of the environmental authorization procedures which are often too widely scattered among too many authorities (authorization of discharges into water, the air. the soil, etc.). This coordination could contribute much to reducing the time needed for authorizing a specific undertaking.
My next remarks are addressed in particular to the Commission: if we read in particular in the Adam report regarding longterm energy objectives that according to the Commission coal must continue to play a rôle not only in consumption but also in prod uction, then our view is that it will not be possible to realize the Commission's objectives in the long term unless an element of certainty is included in the criteria.
For the leading conservation organizations, this firm decision rewards the conservation success of the three African nations whose elephant populations should never have been listed in the CITES Appendix I. The mechanisms and procedures agreed in Harare provide every assurance of adequate safeguards and the conditional decision to allow such trade to resume in the future will prove to be positive and will be of benefit in the long term to elephant conservation throughout Africa.
7.1.10 In order to find adequate sources of funding, the EESC would consider it appropriate to discuss investment incentives in relation to proposals 15 (encouraging the creation of project bonds to finance European projects) and 16 (explore measures with the potential to encourage private investment – particularly in the long term – to make a more active contribution towards achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy) in the communication Towards a Single Market Act.
In view of the recent debate on emissions trading in Germany, we have to keep reminding ourselves that all the parties in Germany are in fact agreed that we need to reduce emissions in the long term by 80% - I repeat 80% by 2050 - and if we are already arguing so energetically against it now, when first steps need to be taken, then I do not hold out much hope for this long-term objective.
The interest of the EEC working population as a whole, in the long term, lies in the adoption of fairly aggressive measures, accepting both the advantages and painful consequences of changes in the international division of labour, forecasting the changing labour requirements skill by skill, describing reversible policies that can be used to alleviate short-term hardships, and encouraging member countries to share the transfer costs of redistributing the burdens of change between different advantaged and disadvantaged groups of workers.
Giving fanning policy a socio-environmental slant could significantly help to: a) b) c) d) e) f) g) stabilize rural areas in the long term, particularly upland and less-favoured areas; improve food quality; meet agriculture's multi-functional remit, i.e. including all the various farming activities; develop competitive agricultural structures to secure the future prospects of farms run by one or several families; safeguard the European agricultural model within the WTO; open up new prospects for young farmers, and prevent desertification and soil erosion.
On the basis of the common criteria, it is assessed that, at present, it has not been verified that Mahan Air has taken all required measures to conform to relevant safety standards and that therefore, it may not yet be withdrawn from Annex A. The Commission will continue to cooperate with the competent authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran to monitor the implementation of corrective actions by Mahan Airlines and to ensure that they provide for sustainable solutions in the long term.
I hardly need point out that this obviously doesn't have positive consequences for the hardworking person in question in the long term.They know to expect more and more work with the feeble excuse "yes, but it's easy for you, isn't it?"Usually we still have the fairness to add that the hard workers in our team take on more than their fair share, but apparently we don't manage to acknowledge that the person in question experiences that as a burden that gets heavier and heavier.
< Invented Name > can be used in the short term for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of atopic eczema and intermittently in the long term for the prevention of progression to flares. < Invented Name > treatment should begin at the first appearance of signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis. < Invented Name > should only be applied to areas affected with atopic dermatitis. < Invented Name > should be used for as short period as possible during flares of disease.
The Commission fleshed out the broad lines of partnership and proposed a financial instrument (MEDA) comparable to PHARE and TACIS, and the Cannes European Council pro duced a financial framework for relations with these countries in June; the Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Barcelona adopted a declaration and a work programme, welcomed by the Madrid European Council as the start ing point for a comprehensive association which will encourage peace, stability and prosperity in the region and the establishment, in the long term, of a free-trade area.
In its evaluation of the questionnaire the Commission drew four important conclusions12: the corridor concept had proved its worth and would be retained; there was a need to act on operational issues and to take socio-economic factors into account; it was worth monitoring progress more closely, but such monitoring should be based on the specific characteristics of each corridor; the positive impact of the corridors could only be estimated in the long term, but the more binding the nature of the cooperation, the more successful that impact will be.
The Committee of the Regions would, however, stress that the fundamental aim of regional competitiveness must be to help to create jobs in the long term and to promote sustainable economic development The Committee shares the views of the experts on the Consultative Group on Competitiveness who have pointed out that "a number of more specific goals, such as increasing profitability or share of world markets, must be regarded as subordinate to the fundamental goal of creating an economy based on high added value and providing a high level of employment.
Such decisions may be motivated not solely by the likelihood of an indirect material profit but also by other considerations, such as a desire to protect the group’s image or to redirect its activities.However, when injections of capital by a public investor disregard any prospect of profitability, even in the long term, such provision of capital must be regarded as aid within the meaning of Article 92 of the Treaty, and its compatibility with the common market must be assessed on the basis solely of the criteria laid down in that provision.’
1988 and 1992, stable and adequate own resources to implement common policies or actions in conjunction with strict budgetary discipline; b) the introduction of stabilizers and the strengthening of existing restrictive measures based on purely budgetary criteria with the aim of halting the rise of EAGGF Guarantee Fund expenditure in the short term and reducing it in the long term; c) the adjustment of certain social and structural measures to accompany the introduction of agricultural stabilizers with the twofold objective of limiting the volume of production and thus contributing to restoring the balance between supply and demand
One problem runs through all the reports: through the opinion by Mrs Cederschiöld on the report of the High Level Group, and through the proposals that have been prepared by Orlando and Bontempi on individual measures. It is music to our ears, Madam Commissioner, when you say that we as a Parliament play an important role, but I have to complete your sentence by adding "if unfortunately not in the right place' , because in the long term the European Parliament will have to be the primary legislative body for combatting organized crime in Europe, and I shall give my reason this morning for saying that.
'The words 'producers ... who have received the holding through ... similar means' in the second indent of the second subparagraph of Article 3a(1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 857/84 of 31 March 1984 adopting general rules for the application of the levy referred to in Article 5c of Regulation (EEC) No 804/68 in the milk and milk products sector, as amended by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1639/91 of 13 June 1991, must be interpreted as meaning that they refer to a producer who ¿v the spouse of the designated heir and to whom the holding has been let on conditions more favourable than market conditions, following the expiry of the nonmarketing undertaking entered into by the lessor (the deviser) under Council Regulation (EEC) No 1078/77 of 17 May 1977 introducing a system of premiums for the nonmarketing of milk and milk products and for the conversion of dairy herds, provided that it follows from all the elements of f act and of law which characterise the letting that: the main intention of the arrangement is that the holding should continue to be exploited for the benefit of the designated heir and not that the market value of the holding should be realised by the deviser, and that the terms of the legal relations between the parties to the contract are such that the advantage which the deviser intends to confer on his heir is guaranteed in the long term, even if the spouses should separate or the marriage be dissolved.''
