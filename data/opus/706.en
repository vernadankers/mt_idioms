Film-maker Alex Roosdorp and his wift cycled 1,000 kilometers through the Netherlands. As they went, he filmed the results of the German occupation: home built in hen coops, children playing with abandoned ammunition and weapons, but also tentative signs of repairs being carried out to damaged homes. Roosdorp & rsquo;s documentary lay unnoticed in the archives of the EYE film museum for over 50 years.
