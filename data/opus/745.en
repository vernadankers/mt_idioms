(Not that they can do much, of course, because their power is primarily a promise, something that seems to be forever stuck in the pipeline, and about which there is mainly a lot of talk, a bit like election promises.
In the pipeline is one prospect which looks set to benefit both the campus’ resident start-ups and the EUR’s entrepreneurially minded students alike. “We might work with Silicon Valley and the University of California,” explains Jansen. “The University of California are interested in what’s going on at the ECE campus, which suggests they’re not satisfied with how they’re organised with the neighbourhood of Silicon Valley.
The first involves combating unemployment. We have to create, not just on paper but with absolute determination - and monitoring its implementation step by step - the 15 million jobs quoted by the Council, by encouraging investment in the vocational training sector, making investment easier and, above all, giving effect immediately to the eleven transEuropean transport proposals already in the pipeline for some time now.
With a draft Directive from the Commission in the pipeline, the Committee proposed at the end of an in-depth discussion and with reference to point 13 of the first consultation paper on ground handling services at airports ('unbundling') that consideration be given to the possibility of invoking Article 87 in an attempt to oblige airports to differentiate in their accounting between airport management activities and ground handling services.
Just last week I was present in the Netherlands at the launch of the first EU-supported microfinance facility and there are more in the pipeline in order to support potential entrepreneurs, perhaps after the experience of being unemployed: women coming back to the labour market after childbirth or people who have already been working and want to seek a new form of enterprise beyond 50, or even 60.
I would also like to say that given this difficulty - and there are many other difficulties - but if I think about this particular one, I think that what is in the pipeline in the future directive, Commissioner, which will be based on Article 13 and which will deal with all the questions other than that of employment, the question of the individualisation of rights will be key.
This is not my analysis, it is the analysis of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD, of Mr Trichet, who is, after all, the head of the euro's monetary guardian, the President of the European Central Bank, and for whom all the measures that have been taken and all the measures that are in the pipeline do not go far enough.
Date: 30 juni 2015 Category: Press Releases The Vlerick Healthcare Management Centre is publishing the results of its Oncology Horizon Scanning project which examines whether Belgium is ready to provide access to the innovative, personalised treatments and medications which are in the pipeline.These are mainly for Cancer, the second most common disease in Belgium and a therapeutic field which is currently characterised by a great deal of progress and innovation.
The EU is currently involved in at least 11 military and police operations around the world, and more are in the pipeline; the list now includes Afghanistan, where NATO troops are killing more and more civilians, and now the EU wants to join in the carnage as soon as possible, when what is needed - and now! - is for the troops to be brought home from Afghanistan and elsewhere.
We made the fuss yesterday partly because we felt that this proposal was coming to the House with unnecessary haste — unnecessary not so far as implementation is concerned but because, frankly, we felt the Commission could well have consulted us long before they did and because we objected to the Parliament's being forced into making an urgent decision on something which had been in the pipeline for a long time.
For example, the foundation of VB-Airsuspension North America Corp., where the first successes in the ambulance and motorhome market have already been chalked up. Or the launch of VB-Airsuspension India Pvt. Ltd. and our very successful showing at the trade fair in New Delhi. VB is starting to make a name for itself in India, with the first deliveries in the pipeline and an enthusiastic response from customers to the first tests.
In the context of proposals for reforming the CFP,the European Commission recently presented an Action Plan for the Mediterranean.The region’s many specific features have to be taken into account to enable ‘Blue Europe’ to guarantee a sustainable activity and to meet the needs of the sector in the best way possible.This is on the way to becoming a reality.A close-up of a multi-faceted region and an overview of the differentmeasures in the pipeline.
The group of experts got down to work in October 1992, its brief being to analyse methodically the past and present situation of the vocational training systems in these countries, to establish an inventory of reforms undertaken or in the pipeline, to assess the first achievements of strategies of change and the contribution made to their success by international cooperation programmes, and, lastly, to produce pointers for implementing cooperation policy in the future.
1 regret, however, that this effort does not go further to deal with several other areas which have a major impact on aviation safety. I note the assurance from the Commission that a number of proposals to cover some of these areas are already in the pipeline, but am particularly concerned at the delay in drawing up proposals to establish a licensing system and minimum working conditions standards for flight crew and for cabin crew, in particular.
As far as the Green Paper is concerned, I must express a certain reticence, mainly because numerous new policy initiatives have been started, important matters are in the pipeline in various Councils and we are now in a position to take action on illiteracy; it would perhaps mean additional delays if we were to proceed with the Green Paper, given that we now have most of the information we need from work carried out in previous years.
In any case, Mr President, since all Groups are practically unanimous on the draft directive and the amendments of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I should like to make two points of a general nature : first on the casuistical method of legislating, since on this subject we have no fewer than the second banking directive, the present draft directive, the forthcoming directive on market tisk and the directive, also in the pipeline, to harmonize the Guarantee Fund.
Bearing in mind that the conference of donors for the stability pact is constantly being postponed - it is now set for the end of March - that no one knows which projects are actually in the pipeline, that one cannot tell how things can actually be implemented, and there is a steady stream of new press conferences, this does not appear to be the way to restore peace and reconciliation amongst peoples to this region of Europe!
The European Commission action plan on company law and corporategovernance is helping ensure companies are well managed andtransparent.For example,since January 2005,all EU listed companies haveto apply international accounting standards so that like can be comparedwith like.There are new rules in the pipeline to make sure that companiesdo not have too cosy a relationship with their auditors,who check andvouch for accounts — a last line of defence against fraud.The Commissionis also working to make sure shareholders who are based in one EU countryand hold shares in another can use their votes at company meetings.
In view of the advances in substantive and procedural areas already made or in the pipeline, such as, amongst others7, the Communication from the Commission on European contract law8 and the Rome II instrument on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations9, it would be advisable, as a minimum, for all aspects of private international law contained in the various above instruments and documents mentioned to be systematically linked in a single instrument, directly applicable in all Member States, as a means of ensuring uniform application of standardised rules of conflict of laws in all the Member States.
Seamless steel pipe in the pipeline before the need to rust paint, and seamless square tube is made of first, galvanized, galvanized way is mainly divided into galvanized and hot galvanized in two ways, we usually see galvanized seamless square pipes are generally hot-dip galvanized because hot-dip galvanized seamless tubes are much stronger than galvanized seamless steel tubes because the main purpose of seamless square pipes is for construction steel structure, color steel room, etc., will inevitably be the erosion of wind and rain, a long time there may be rust off, rotten. So it is necessary to have a whole outside the protective film, but the paint looks too ugly, and could not help but exposure, so someone came up with a galvanized approach.
