Regarding the above-mentioned CO2 emissions policy and, in particular, the European Emissions Trading System (EST), the EESC's CCMI wishes to draw the attention of the Commission and the Council to the fact that data from recent years indicate that the high price of CO2 emission rights can prove to be more of a lure than the production of greater volumes of cement, even for the most modern European cement plants which lead the way in the reduction of CO2 emissions.
Whereas, in order to ensure uniform application of the nomenclature of the Common Customs Tariff, provisions will have to be adopted for the classification of raw, frozen pou/trymeat, in particular turkey meat, obtained by scraping poultry bones from which the prime cuts have been removed or in any other way (for example, in the reduction of larger cuts to smaller size) and consisting of small irregularly shaped pieces, sometimes with fibrous, gristly and fatty tissue attached thereto and individually weighing from 5 to 40 grams approximately;

Mr President, I apologise for this, but colleagues will recognise that this situation is changing daily and the oral amendment is not quite the same as that listed on some people's sheets so I will read it out: 'Expresses its solidarity with the people of Pakistan who are victims of the violence perpetrated by the armed extremists; is deeply concerned for the safety of the 1800 or more people in the Red Mosque, some of whom were held as hostages; recognises the challenges the siege posed to the Government of Pakistan; expresses its grave concern about the still unknown number of victims and supports the efforts to bring those responsible to justice'.
The real danger in rejecting Mary’s divine maternity is that it draws too much of a distinction between Christ’s dual natures, effectively dividing Him into two persons: the divine Jesus and the human Jesus. More or less, this is what Nestorius did, openly admitting on one occasion he would have difficulty calling the Infant Jesus God. Ultimately, Nestorianism threatened belief in the Redemption. For if such a distinction could be drawn between Christ’s divinity and humanity, then it could be said–even must be said–that God did not actually die for our sins. If the babe born to Mary was not truly God, then the man who was nailed to the Cross and rose from the dead could not have been either!

Among the guidelines in the report to which I drew attention were not only monetary policies that would steer clear of any acceleration in inflation and the removal of obstacles to taking on labour and the strengthening of competitiveness, but also other objectives which were not in fact included in the report to the European Council but which are in the annual report to the Commission, for example, the general objective of a progressive increase in the actual and potential growth rate, combined with low and declining inflation, a pause in the reduction of deficits, where these have been brought soundly under control, in order to reduce tax burdens; and the need to develop cooperative action with the United States and Japan to sustain an adequate overall growth in world trade in the period ahead when the contribution from the United States will apparently be reduced.
