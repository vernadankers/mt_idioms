The story of Faust and his pact with the devil, the tale of Frankenstein, the wizard's apprentice, and the film 'Blade Runner' all come to mind as just a few of the more outstanding examples.
In the more laid-back vocal segments a name like Masters Of Reality might come to mind, and when it's getting more rough something like their brothers in arms QOTSA.Most tracks can go by almost unnoticed, but when the band digs into a theme more deeply, it can be pretty interesting.For example the tension in 'Ready' can actually be quite striking, despite the not very virtuosic guitars (or maybe just because of that), which are very expressive.
A true shame, because even the non-Alternative Tentacles stuff like 'Harshing You Mellow'is well worth the effort of checking out, a recent re-release by AT just acknowledges this.Coming from a background of more filthy, crusty hardcore, through records like 'Forging Steel And Laying Stone' the band has measured itself a more sludge-based sound, even to the point where Black Sabbath cannot be unnamed.Especially the sound of the guitars make Tony Iommi come to mind, while the bass still sounds undeniably "hardcore".
Sánchez García (ARE). ­ (ES) Mr President, Mr Gonzá­lez, Mr Santer, ladies and gentlemen, looking from a· radical point of view and that of the outermost regions at the documents from the European Council held in Madrid last December, which discussed the economic revival of Europe in a socially integrated framework, a Europe open to the citizens and to the world, together with the laying of the foundations of the Europe of the future, four very basic conclusions come to mind:
Clwealm plays black/death metal in the way it was done in the mid-90s. the biography mentions bands such as Dissection, Sacramentum and Unanimated as references, and I can definitely agree on that.However, Cwealm is more than that and comes with a progressive approach to the genre, in which the names Mörk Gryning, Emperor ('Anthems To The Welkin At Dusk' era), Dimmu Borgir ('Spiritual Black Dimensions' era) en Covenant ('Nexus Polaris'), Obtained Enslavement, but also Carach Angren come to mind frequently, but especially Diabolical Masquerade.
There is a “growing religious cynicism, grounded in the sense that the church that speaks justice to the world refuses to practice justice within the church itself.”(1) Many examples come to mind: clericalism and the oppression of the people by the clerical caste; sexual abuse by clergy and its cover-up by many bishops, enforced priestly celibacy, the enormous decline in the number or male priests and the consequent crisis in the parishes; the decline of nearly all the great religious orders; and of course the question of women in the church.
