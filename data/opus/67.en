How it warms the hearts of everyone when a person comfortably seated spontaneously offers his seat to someone who is elderly, a mother with a babe in arms or an individual who is apparently not very strong!
So it became plain to me that baptizing a babe in arms was unscriptural.
Jesus was portrayed, not as the willing intercessor for sinful men, but as a babe in arms or as a fearsome judge, more given to condemning and punishing sinners than to saving them.
