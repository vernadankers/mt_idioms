This had been in the works before we met.
like we think about it we ruminate about it and the thing that i always remind my clients about this topic specifically is those thoughts and feelings are normal, people have that when we're depressed when we're anxious when we're struggling with something thats really difficult for us. we may have thoughts of suicide and not necessarily serious thoughts like im going to do this now, but rather like this would be easier if i wasnt here, it would be easier and i wouldnt have to fight this, you know we have those thoughts and i know this sounds bad, but thats normal ok? so we will have those thoughts and what also is normal is that those thoughts go away. if we give them enough time, if we work on it, if we have a safety plan in place those thoughts will go away. ok? so this is something we can fight through. we can succeed i dont any of you to hurt yoursel i want you all living i want you all breathing i want you all having the adventurous wonderful lives tha you deserve ok? so thats why ive created all these videos, so we can help ourselves, ok? and when i was doing research into creating safety plans, cos i have one that i do in my office, but everyones different, right and everybody has different things, so i looked it up and there are a lot of templates online. so you can actually google safety plan templates and boom, youve got some easy fill in PDFs and you can print out an fill it in ok? so the first thing that i do with my clients when we're talking about a safety plan is keeping them safe. is your environment safe?is there something that you plan on hurting yourself with. are you stocking up on your pills and not taking them like youre supposed to? does it make you nervous to have a full months perscription hanging out in your house? we might want to give that to someone else for safe keeping and have them ration them for us. or if its a knife or if its a gun or, who knows what your thoughts are, we may not want to have that around. right, so with my clients im like hey what if you brought that in and i kept it for a week and then gave it back to you, how would that feel and would you be willing to do that? so thats number one on my list. then the second thing is noticing the warning signs now this is something we can actually help one another with and if you want to leave comments on how you notice when youre feeling suicidal and when you feel the emotions and the thoughts around that building up how do you notice that. what are your key cues and things that you are doing or arent doing. so we can all share in the insight and we can help one another so we can nip it in the bud before it all gets out of control. so thats the second thing and thats noticing. now the most important thing with my clients is that i want it to be in your language so take your journal out or take that template you find online and i want you to write it in your words, like i find that i sleep until noon or i watch a sad tv show, like Greys Anatomy or something i was just talking with Cara about this about how its kind of a sad show, so if you watch something thats kind of triggering to your suicidal ideations or you depression or whatever it is i might start cancelling plans or i might not do my homework what is it? or do you feel things like i feel really anxious and i get sweaty, or i feel really lathargic and i ache, or, what is it? kind of pay attention to that and start putting it into your own language and your own responses and thats kind of why i think that sharing will really help, because we might not recognise it as something like that and that its tied to that, but if someone else says yeah i do that too, and i think thats whats really powerful in our community is that we share a lot of similarities and we can really help one another. so thats the second part ok? so we have making sure that your environment is safe and noticing when its creeping up and the other thing is creating a call list or support list of friends or family who can help you so we need personal connections, so whether its our best friend at school, whether its our school counsellor its our boyfriend, girlfriend, mum, dad, brother, sister, make a list of emails or numbers or how you would best like to contact them. i always tell my clients atleast contact five people before you give up. the more we can contact the better and i know we're scared and we dont want to talk about it. but just reach out and say i could really just use a friend becuase i need to vent you dont have to tell them exactly whats going on, but just sometimes talking and getting those emotions out can feel so much better. right so we have three things so far. we have make sure our environment is safe, we have given away the thing that we're going to use we have noticed and been writing down the triggers and things that we notice changing when our suicide ideation goes up and our depression gets worse, and we've made a list of our friends and family that we can reach out to. now the next step, step number four is professionals. so that would be if i was your therapist you would put me down. i would definitely put down our community and my website and twitter to reach out there easily and i hear from lots of you and its great that youre reaching out thats another nice outlet and part of why i creatd this whole community, right so that can be a suicidal hotline. every country has one, i know they do, i dont know all the numbers but you can just google suicide hotline UK or suicide hotline Germany or wherever you are and it will tell you and i also would put down your local hospitals becuase you can just take yourself there and you can go in and say youre having a hard time, and i have a lot of clients whove done that and they get a really good response, so, any professionals, thats what we're going to do, after our friends and family. so those are the things i go through with my clients when creating a suicide safety plan. and we need to make sure that this list feels authentic to us, becuase we're all different, we're all unique. we all struggle with different things, even though we may have some similarities, we still have those differences i mean i always tell a lot of you that i like to colour when im stressed out i also like to watch lover listed alot i dont know why. so we all have those different things that feel good to us and we all have those little things that we do when we're having a bad day and we need to take time to realise that and to write it down and to use it, because this is whats going to save us when we feel like we cant get out and we're in this dark hole. so like i said leave your comments below how do you notice when your suicidal thoughts are getting worse. even what do you do along with how do you notice, what do you do? because the more we help one another the more powerful our community is and the more we help one another and the more we grow. and if you like these topics and you want me to keep taking about suicide, give it a thumbs up and dont forget to subscribe. and i still have my free workbook on my website, im in the works to get other things out i know that many of you have requested that, and dont worry i always listen and make notes so ill make sure to get through that. so just keep working with me. keep fighting those negative voices trying to pull us down and we'll work towards a healthy mind and a healthy body. oh and it just occurred to me also, i know many of you have reached out to me and you're like kati, i just cant call a suicide hotline, it makes me so nervous right, and we dont want to do it but i want you all to know, and ive actually had a friend who was on call with the suicide hotline cos thats really what it is, theyre on call, so they have to make themselves available for certain chunks of time. so that when you call you get somebody every time. and theyre trained professionals, theyre people just like me, people who are passionate about what they do and they actaully sign up to do that and take those chunks of time because they want to help its usually a volunteer position you dont get paid for it, so its people who actually care and want to support us. i mean ive been doing this for almost a year and a half and in the last 6 months or so ive heard from a lot of you, that youve called in, you were really nervous to call, but then you got connected with somebody and they were so warm and so nice and they were wonderful and some of them even spent hours on the phone with you until you felt better and you know, all was calm again
