Dell'Alba (ARE). - (IT) Mr President, Mr Friedmann should not be surprised if the House is hardly full to bursting, and also if there are spaces in the press gallery: it is because, once again, we have read much more of this re port in the newspapers over the past few days than we have heard here from the horse's mouth today.
I have it from the horse's mouth herself.
OH, I AM. AND I CAN'T STAY LONG, BUT, UH, I WANTED TO HEAR FROM THE HORSE'S MOUTH WHY BENTON KILLED EDGEHILL.
Before we take her off your hands, I wanna hear from the horse's mouth that there's no chance of us getting a male.
It'd be cool, straight from the horse's mouth

So … straight from the horse's mouth so to speak … What/when/ How/ why/ is this EVENT all about?
- Yeah, from the horse's mouth actually.
