The fact is that this House is always being promised jam tomorrow if only we would be patient.
As in Alice in Wonderland, it is jam yesterday, jam tomorrow, but never jam today â€” with the qualification that under Council policy jam tomorrow is unlikely to be available for reasons which I will refer to in a moment.
To me it is a deal that promises the EU jam tomorrow and gives the US the jam today.
