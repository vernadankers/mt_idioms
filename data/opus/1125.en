Many of us tend to think everything has already been said about love, and we cannot seem to see any outstanding aspect that has not been touched onâ¦ and maybe itâs true, a lot has been said over the topic of loveâ¦ but, it is in the new revelation of old knowledge that we come to truly experience what seemed to have been so clear to us, but realizing that it has never been as clear as it is now, because God chose the time and place to unveil another breathtaking aspect of His true love, in a way beyond words or expectations.

Getting the gold requires multiple digs in the right places. However, see the next paragraph. To get out, you have to get the enemy to go over the top of the 1 and fill the pit at the bottom. There are three ways to do this. The first and most sensible is to wait on the pole above the top right edge of the 1 until the enemy is almost upon you and then move to the right, digging to your right as you reach the bottom of the 1. The second way involves timing your digging for the gold (or where the gold was); moving onto the gold at the right time will cause the enemy to fall into the pit on the right of the 1. The third way is to destroy the enemy and hope he reappears over the right side of the 1.
