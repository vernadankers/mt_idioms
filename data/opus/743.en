Mr Sherlock. — My question follows very naturally on that of Mrs Squarcialupi, particularly having visited some of, shall I say, our more southerly Member States. Even if the legislation is in the offing, is there any real hope among members of the Council that enforcement is likely to follow it?
Leaving aside the fact that the Commission could do more to avoid giving this impression — and I trust the House takes note of my cautious formulation — I feel that a number of modifications are in the offing and they should have the effect of removing these points of contention.
The commitment has been made to strengthen the common market and to decide, before the end of March, in barely three months that is, on the Commission's priority proposals — i.e. a package of 30 or so regulations and directives, some of which have been in the offing for many years.
In the light of all that has been said I am convinced that, were the Community not confronted with the difficulties it is currently experiencing, and were an election not in the offing, then I would have urged refusal of the discharge, with the subsequent vote of no confidence which this implies.
In view of the acceptance of this fundamentally new situation as a political reality, and the Member States' determination increasingly to align their cooperation policies within the Community framework,1the Community made careful preparations for the inter national meetings in the offing, in particular the seventh special, session of the UN General Assembly.
The striving to examine the interaction between object and subject precisely from the point of view in which the subject appears in an active role, derived from the public mood of the period in which the world-outlook of Marx and Engels was taking shape.

Interpenetration is particularly strong in this sector between implementation of the liberalizationpolicy, cases notified or investigated ex-officio, the reforms of international satellite organizations suchas Intelsat, and the negotiations within the World Trade Organization on basic telecommunications.There is a need for foresight, given the new technologies and massive investment that are in the offing,
Mr President, over the past few weeks, and with the EU-India Summit in the offing – it is taking place in The Hague at the beginning of November – the Dutch Human Rights ambassador has declared that the violation of the rights of 260 million outcaste Dalits is an international human rights problem.

It is true that, as a result of the policy of readjustment adopted by the Chinese in 1979, Community exports continued to de cline in the first half of 1982, but with the conclusion of important contracts and the reactivation of certain large projects there would seem to be an improvement in the offing.

From 1969 to this was hard.

When God created man and provided him with that wonderful Eden home, the commission was given to multiply and fill the earth, and subdue it.Nothing was said to Adam and Eve about going to heaven when they died; indeed, death was not in the offing for them as long as they remained obedient to the Creator's laws.
They sensed that war with each other was in the offing, and so both Germany and France abandoned the gold standard by ceasing to pay their government officials in gold coins, and instead paying them with paper money. -Right, whereby one is still under the impression that it's being backed by the government: 'It will turn out alright'.
With 1992 in the offing and hand in hand with the development of the Erasmus and 'Yes for Europe' programmes, it is essential that young people become more involved in the even more numerous and varied activities — cultural, artistic, sporting, musical, etc. — stemming from town twinning schemes, which to my mind are the plinth of the European edifice.
Wheat growers, in particular, will be affected very badly, which they already are because of a 15% fall in prices, but then there is also a tightening up on quality and with regard to the issue of protein crops. This means, moreover, that, especially in the northern part of the EU, there will be further price falls in the offing.
I warn the Commission that its justified concerns about market laws allows it to forget, so to speak, that our citizens expect more of Europe, that they expect a cultural Europe, which is why I am strongly in favour of negotiating a compromise here, of giving the Austrian and German book trade time to implement the solution which is in the offing.
That puts the institutional balance under severe strain and, in view of events in the offing, such as the intergovernmental conference, for instance, the Commission would do well not to be seen as a sort of technocracy that was oblivious of the realities of the need for democracy and instead demonstrate its commitment to the cause of making our system more democratic.
With the G8 summit in the offing, I want to underline the fundamental demands, made above all by many African movements, for fair trade to be guaranteed, for the poorer countries’ debt crisis to be brought to an end, for far more resources to be made available for aid, and for it to be ensured that such aid is of the highest quality.
The events in your galaxy, solar system and on Earth are quickly moving forward and great change is in the offing.

What a glorious work lies ahead of those who survive the end of this “conclusion of the system of things ” and who enter into that new system where the fiery - colored horse, the black horse and the pale horse followed by Hades will no more streak through the inhabited earth ​ — especially so with the resurrection of all redeemed mankind in the offing!
At the moment the only conclusion we can draw is that these problems have always been in the offing, that we face enormous problems that the agricultural policy is indeed in very serious danger, that for more than a month now the Commission has not been able to honour its commitments, that cuts are already being made wherever possible and that this situation may have very serious consequences.
All of us here agree on what those challenges are: Parliament needs to be adapted to its increased powers after the expected entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty; elections are in the offing, and the election campaign has to be funded; new rules on MEPs' remuneration are to be adopted, as well as - let us hope - transparent rules governing the employment and remuneration of parliamentary assistants.
Because if that was not the case, this would mean that there would be a tribunal in all Member States of the European Union for administering justice on patent infringement procedures, and that could mean that a German company could find itself in a tribunal in country X, far removed from the registered office of that company, and with enlargement in the offing, that could imply far greater distances still.
Although I utterly devote myself to Parliament - I think that I, like several other Members, have a 100% attendance record - it is due to a constant desire for dialogue, because I am a firm believer in seeking consensus, perhaps because I think that a victory where one' s opponent is crushed is a defeat in the sense that the victory always contains an element of the war in the offing.
However, Madam President, the political problem is that these murders were planned and carried out deliberately with the aim of creating the impression that the two communities in Cyprus are incapable of living together in harmony and, therefore, of justifying the ethnic cleansing and the absolute separation of the two populations, precisely at this time when initiatives are in the offing for the commencement of processes that can lead to a solution of the Cyprus problem. We must not fall for this ploy.
What I find regrettable about this sort of thing is that it is yet more evidence of our inability to trust those who administer the funds, and so I ask, as a matter of urgency, that there be no repetition of it, or else we will see a great gulf opening up between old and new, between those countries that contribute and those that receive, and that is precisely what we cannot afford with the financial perspective and the debates on it in the offing.
It is precisely because a new text would appear to be in the offing, and because the contradiction — underlined by Commissioner Richard — which exists between the means and the goals outlined with a view to harmonizing temporary employment in the 10 Member States must be reconciled, that the most expedient solution would seem to be such a new text. That is why I feel it would be wise, both for the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, and for the House, to be aware of this at the outset.
I do believe, though, that, in difficult times such as these, we in this House have to start by finding a line on which we can all agree, and for that there have not yet been enough talks, while, moreover, events in Palestine are threatening to overtake us, so that we are in a situation in which a half-baked resolution without any really broad basis would certainly not help, particularly when there is a visit by you in the offing, and so I propose that the resolution be withdrawn for these reasons - not out of any change of opinion on our part, but rather because we want to find sufficient time for talks with the other groups.
The signs of a drop in investments directly > connected with production are obvious, as are those of the rarity or complete lack of subsidized loans and the reduction in employment opportunities compared with the past. In the south of Italy, ladies and gentlemen, there are entire areas — of which I have direct experience — where the entire apparatus of their base industries — steel, petrochemicals, textiles, non-ferrous metals, food — are rapidly disappearing without trace, while at the same time there is no sign of alternative industries and new pros pects for investment in the offing. Given the situation, I agree with Mr Costanzo that the additional incentives for structural investment pro posed by the Commission give rise to a certain amount of doubt and therefore need to be carefully assessed, case by case, as applied.
