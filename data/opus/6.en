First, unlike reset --hard, checkout is working-directory safe; it will check to make sure it’s not blowing away files that have changes to them. Actually, it’s a bit smarter than that – it tries to do a trivial merge in the Working Directory, so all of the files you haven’t changed in will be updated. reset --hard, on the other hand, will simply replace everything across the board without checking.
5.7 Turkey's current alignment with EU internal market law has advanced in certain areas, such as the free movement of goods, competition policy and state aid, energy, economic and monetary policy, and enterprise and industrial policy, but the European Commission has highlighted the fact that Turkey consistently turns a blind eye to key aspects of the agreement by adopting protectionist measures across the board, contrary to what is provided for under the Customs Union.
I believe the role played by thousands of small and medium-sized European entrepreneurs needs to be supported with solutions to the difficulties and constraints that they have pointed out on several occasions: I am referring to better access to credit, the possibility of more transparent and less costly participation in public calls for tender and, above all, administrative simplification across the board, which everyone regards as the real revolution that this continent now needs.
NEWENS (S). — In view of the appalling results of the debt burden, to which Mr Cheysson has already referred, with developing countries being obliged to export more than they import to service debts with all the implications that has for the possibilities of development, should it not now be accepted across the board that loan repayments should in no circumstances be allowed to exceed a fixed percentage of a debtor country's foreign exchange earnings?
A very good or excellent performance means that across the board your performance extends far beyond the set requirements, and that you achieve demonstrably excellent results.The performance bonus amounts to a maximum of 15% of your salary.In principle, the performance bonus can be granted for a maximum of one year, but may be extended if the faculty or unit is of the opinion that you still fulfil your position in a 'excellent' or 'very good' manner.
I am told, for example, by colleagues in the Committee on Development and Cooperation that despite the protestations of the Committee on Budgetary Control, we still have a situation existing where key lines of the budget authority, key lines of this Parliament, such as those in Chapter 9 of the budget, are still being cut by 2% across the board in order to make sure that the Commission has resources to make proposals to fill the negative reserve.
All these things considered, it can certainly be said that we have, together, come up with plenty of flexible solutions, and we do of course hope that this legislation will, during the planned period of two years, find its way into the new AETR and thus become applicable to those states that are not members of the European Union, but whose vehicles do use the EU’s roads, so that equality of competition may be established across the board.
Equally, however, in response to the Commission’s ideas – and you, President Prodi, have presented some interesting keywords, although we will have to discuss them in far more detail – I must say that what is urgently required in the coming months is a critical review of the European Union’s agenda, with a focus on both positive and negative aspects across the board in all policy fields, if we want to identify honest and practical responses for Europe’s citizens.
In other words, the Commission cannot ignore the fact that a discrepancy of 3% with regard to the minimum objective of 60% of government debt is due to an increase in current expenditure, or maybe to tax cuts across the board, or to a policy of boosting public and private investment - for example, in research, in training, in retraining workers of retirement age who wish to continue working - especially considering that such investment is recognised, formally recognised, by the Commission itself as an objective of common interest.
Continuous adjustment may sound very simple, “but structure and the infrastructure that you have to put in place to support that is a fundamental change that needs to happen across the board,” Dehghani says. “It’s really sad, because sometimes we go through a lot of hurdles and do experimentations and we actually find out that very, very small change could make such a big difference in the bottom line, but we don’t have the capability to make that a production ready code that can scale and can consume all traffic.”
The recent adoption of a United Nations strategy, with the aim of stepping up international cooperation with third countries in combating terrorism also represents an important advance, and the European Union is prepared to join with all other states belonging to the United Nations in implementing it; this is one of its priorities for the future, and it intends to make use of its dialogue with external partners to press for the implementation of this strategy across the board, as also for an exchange of ideas as to how this goal might best be achieved.
An initial raft of amendments tabled by our group there fore raises yet again the fact that the Commission pro posal, in its Agenda 2000 report, is inadmissible, not only because of the unacceptable nature of a price reduction across the board, but also because of the risks of a dis torted sense of competition that would follow from a rampant renationalization of the CAP, fervently sought by many Member States, and from a suicidal anticipation of the results of future WTO negotiations, which begin in December 1999, at the instigation of the United States and the Cairns Group.
= > Employment policy has moved decisively to the top of the European agenda. The new employment Title in the Treaty of Amsterdam makes employment a matter of common concern. The Luxembourg Jobs Summit followed by the adoption of the 1998 Employment Guidelines and the submission of national employment action plans has brought forward the co-ordination of Member States' employment policies through the development of an integrated employment strategy. = > A number of key legislative proposals has been adopted by the Council, helping to complete and consolidate the framework of minimum social standards needed to underpin the Single Market. This progress has been facilitated by the use of the more collaborative form of decision making, involving the social partners, introduced by the Agreement on Social Policy. = > A set of detailed and ambitious work programmes has been adopted by the Commission. These policy initiatives - for example the Action Plan for free movement of workers and the Green Paper on work organisation - provide the building blocks for the ongoing renewal of social policy. They are listed in Annex 1. = > The social policy debate has been broadened and deepened to areas of mutual concern - such as demographic trends, modernising social protection and the fight against racism - where there is clear value-added in common European debate, co-operation and exchange of information and best practice. = > The social dialogue is yielding solid achievements and the civil dialogue has matured, helping to reinforce the legitimacy and effectiveness of Europeanlevel activity. = > The linkages between social policy and other Community policies have been strengthened, reflecting the conviction that social progress must be promoted across the board. Examples of this are the commitment to mainstreaming equality of opportunities between women and men, the integration of health protection requirements into other Community policies, and the 1997 Communication on environment and employment.
