To date, however, the interdepartmental working party, which was to bring social advancement education, VDAB training courses, training for the middle classes and, possibly at a later date, 'second-chance' education and the projects for the underprivileged closer together with a view to coordinating adult education as a whole, has failed to get off the ground.
Since the. European Council in March 1982 which enable the programme for Central America to get off the ground and was a first step towards the definition of a common policy in Central America, it seems to me that too little time has elapsed for us already to expect to see convergence on the spot.
The main point I wish to make thus clearly relates to the area of staffing. We are calling for a strengthening of the European Community's supervisory mechanisms and of supervisory staff so as to ensure that the kinds of fraudulent manipulations that we have in other areas simply do not get off the ground in fisheries.
In this sector therefore we are not allowing the common market to get off the ground and there fore one of the greatest efforts to be made in the immediate future is to convince the ministers for posts and the other ministers concerned that they have to open up their markets and radically alter their purchasing policies.
It also applies to the liberalization of the capital market. But the significance of this does not in the final analysis depend on whether, for example, a multiannual tech nological programme and the other R & D programmes get off the ground, with all the necessary — I would even say, minimum necessary — consequences for the budget.
Madam President, Commissioners, one year after the earthquake, Haiti is still in a state of emergency and reconstruction efforts are struggling to get off the ground. This is attributable to the structural deficiencies of the Haitian State, to the Haitian authorities' lack of political will and decision making capability, and to a lack of support from the international community.
As the Commission states in its action programme, experience shows that in the absence of a basic legal framework of the kind which exists in the United States to determine the type of action to be taken, the means to be used and the sanctions which must be imposed, action of this kind does not get off the ground.
All I would say is that, in this crucial area - there are others, too, in the financial world - we, the Council - it is not even the European Council - and the European Parliament have to be able to work together to ensure that on 1 January - and that is the deadline - the new institutions can get off the ground.
My concern is twofold: firstly, as regards what will America do with those it does not file charges against who, if returned to their own countries of origin, may face torture and death for reasons of unrelated Islamic militancy; and secondly, with regard to paragraph 5 of the resolution, which suggests a role for the international criminal court, which has yet to get off the ground?
I wish to stress the point, as mentioned by Mr Rack, that this is an example of a good public-private partnership (PPP), with, of course, the support not only of Eurocontrol - something on which you insisted - but also of the whole air transport industry, which of course will be the main beneficiary and is therefore very interested in seeing SESAR get off the ground.
This programme for attainment of a Communitywide market will be consonant with the "high technology" programme that we will be presenting to the European Council—which, in turn, cannot get off the ground until the Communitywide market is a reality. Introduction of the new technologies implies three prerequisites: the harmonization of standards, the liberalization of public contracts and common legislation on industrial property, particularly important for biotechnologies.'
The next question is addressed to both the Council and the Commission and includes a proposal or explicit recommendation: is it not advisable to concentrate Community cofinancing as a priority, if not exclusively, on the 48 cross-border sections of the 30 projects: those that straddle two Member States, which in many cases do not get off the ground as a result of conflicts of competences or interest?
The situation in the country remains very complex and chaotic, reconstruction efforts are struggling to get off the ground, millions of people are starving, and the earthquake has had a huge impact on more than 800 000 children, exposing them to the risk of violence, sexual abuse, trafficking and exploitation, The situation in the country became even worse with a political crisis following the presidential and parliamentary elections.
shortcomings of the European Union, as determined and set en route on that occasion, are clear: a weak decisiontaking process - too often blocked by the interests of the individual states - with complex procedures to which you yourself drew attention, Madam President-in-Office; a common foreign policy which frequently fails to get off the ground - the failure effectively to apply the third pillar which we shall be discussing this afternoon.
However, after these two years it is vital that progress reports be produced on an annual basis and should it transpire that the Commission had in fact been right when it had still had enough courage to say that in the absence of basic structured legislation action did not get off the ground, it can at least not lose too much time before coming up with a proposal for a directive after all.
It is not without purpose that we in this House included an amount in the budget to enable the Fourth Action Programme to get off the ground, although I am quite critical of' the fact that Parliament decided to put one million less into the budget than the Commission requested, but it would be scandalous if this work for equal opportunities for men and women and thus equal treatment for men and women in Europe were to get bogged down.
Or: how the cult of the permanent vicarious revolution gradually seems to make place for a new variant: the cult of the vicarious success - no longer the endeavour to transfer the revolution that after the Second World War did not get off the ground from the real world into the galleries, but the conquest of the walls of galleries and museums by those who did not succeed in the real world (of politicians, scientist, sport- and chess-heroes, film- and rock stars - and real artists).
But this ‘Europe of Projects’ can never get off the ground until Member State governments explain to their people what they are doing together in Brussels and why, and until we give the Union the money and the legal powers to push through initiatives like the common energy policy, which faces an uphill struggle against blocking forces in the Council, as too do many other initiatives in the field of justice and home affairs, for example, where the absence of qualified majority voting so often results in stalemate.
The geopolitical situation, poverty - an increasingly serious problem - and the growth of terrorism - there are now cells in all the countries of the globe - must prompt us to start work at Laeken on a project to introduce genuine joint intelligence, new intelligence which is not created or developed along the same lines as Europol but which is capable of being used transparently with political, economic and cultural analysts who will be able to focus our foreign policy on that cooperation and timely intervention without which the European Union, with or without institutional reforms, will not be able to get off the ground.
As long as the Commission is not prepared to take on board Parliament's constructive criticism of this economic policy, which is based on superficiality, wishful thinking and unilateral opportunism as far as the financial markets are concerned, and as long as it is not prepared to enter into conflict with the Council, and in particular with certain particularly powerful Member States, including Germany, then all the Commission's initiatives, which in themselves are to be welcomed, and which are intended, somehow and in spite of everything, to improve the way in which the unemployment problem is taken into consideration, will either never get off the ground or will, at best, remain relatively ineffectual.
Although we take a different view from the Commission on many proposals and although the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and this House too made it clear during the last vote, despite many motions in favour, that we see a need for quite different provisions from those the Commission is prepared to accept, that we see a need for different competences, a different- rate of regulating the in dividual national labels, we have said : OK, we are prepared to accept less in order to give the whole undertaking a chance to get off the ground, so that the Environment Council can decide at the end of this week.
