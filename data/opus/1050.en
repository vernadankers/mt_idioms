Then the priest took some of its blood and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and poured out all the rest of its blood at the base of the altar.
Although shiftworkers had significantly lower M scores than either of the non-shiftworking groups on the CTQ, this difference was not repeated on the Horne & Ostberg scale, or the M scale of the CTI. Likewise, the shiftworkers scored significantly lower than the general public (and almost so than the students, p < 0.06) on Rigidity of sleep (Rs) scale of the CTI, but not on that of the CTQ. These inconsistencies clearly raise doubts as to the comparability of these scales across the different questionnaires, a matter that will be returned to when considering the intercorrelations between the various scales.
