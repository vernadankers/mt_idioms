In this motion we are therefore asking the Commis sion to reconsider the quotas it has set, decide whether they are indeed fair, and above all to ensure that the other measures taken — social, regional and economic policy, intervention and aids under the ECSC Treaty — are appropriate : those measures which we consider should go hand in hand with any market intervention.
RECALLS that the EU has gradually developed policies which have proved their worth, both at home and internationally, which seek to ensure that economic and social progress go hand in hand; HIGHLIGHTS in particular the relevance in this respect of the Lisbon strategy and its set of mutually reinforcing policies to promote competitiveness, employment, social cohesion and a sustainable environment, thus promoting greater policy coherence;
On the basis of the report submitted by the Commission President, Jacques Delors, in June 1989, the Madrid European Council defined the objectives in broad terms: the Community was to embark on a process comprising several stages, the first of which was to begin on 1 July 1990, and culminating in the introduction of a single currency. Monetary and economic progress would go hand in hand.
I fully support Mrs Van Lancker's report and I would like, in particular, to stress a point which has, moreover, already been raised by both the rapporteur and Mrs Péry in their speeches, and that is the need for all the instruments to be genuinely implemented at European level, and therefore for application of the open coordination method to go hand in hand with reinforcement of the legal dimension.
At the same time, it encouraged the EIB to examine the range of its operations and, where appropriate, to extend these to infrastructural investment in the areas of health, education and urban renewal The Council recommended that adher ence to the principle of financing only economically viable projects should go hand in hand with strict compliance with customary banking principles, implying notably that loans should be secured by adequate guarantees.
For instance, the Commission emphasised that "economic growth, social inclusion and environmental protection go hand in hand, both in Europe and in other parts of the world", and said that it wished to put "sustainable development at the core of EU policy-making", pointing to "the need for clearer objectives, targets and related deadlines as a way of giving focus to action in priority areas and enabling progress to be measured.
I believe that we are heading towards a European architecture in which liberty and security go hand in hand, and in which in effect - and I think Mrs Roth was quite right to bring this up - it will be necessary to keep careful watch that a correct balance is maintained between the legitimate aspiration of the people for more liberty within our European Union, and their aspiration, no less legitimate, for more security.
2.6 is convinced that enlargement of the European Union must go hand in hand with a concentration of the Union's tasks on genuinely European challenges, and calls for the concentrated and reformed tasks of the European Union to be set out clearly in the Treaties or the future constitutional Treaty; also believes, however, that the European Union should continue to be able to react flexibly to the growing challenges and be given the tools necessary to tackle them successfully.
The situation described by the Commission in the Green Paper, and the need for an adequate response to the social challenges it outlines, confirm our view, already set out in the White Paper on growth, competitiveness and employment, that Europe also shares an urgent need for tripartite agreements which define appropriate policies to ensure that 'economic and social progress [...] go hand in hand' and which set down specific objectives and 'rules of the game' at the various negotiating levels, including the European level.
9.5 We are at a crossroads: the EESC cannot understand how the procrastination and indecision of Europe, the first economy in the world, are being allowed to risk strangling Greece, the mother of its principles and a minute entity in economic terms36, requiring sacrifices from people and businesses, which do not go hand in hand with a plan to support growth, which is the only way to repay the debt, and a plan to relieve the serious social hardship of part of the population of Greece and Europe as a whole.
When analysing the influence and involvement of groups in society in terms of drawing up environmental policy and, more specifically, policy with a view to sustainable development, the emphasis is placed usually on the analysis of environmental movements, the influence of green parties, shifts in the direction of post-industrial and more qualitative social values, and so on. People often overlook the fact that the interventions of the modern society on the environment go hand in hand with radical changes in economic/industrial policy. Therefore, the basic hypothesis behind this investigative model is that the parties most closely involved in determining economic/industrial policy are also vitally important if a fully-fledged policy for sustainable development has to be realised.
