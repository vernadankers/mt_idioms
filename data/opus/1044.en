Whilst the proposal on the face of it has a great deal of merit - for one thing it would greatly increase the flexibility available to the European Investment Bank in meeting the needs of its client countries - it does clearly, Mr President, raise a number of important questions.
Mr Richard. — I must say that I admire the skill of the honourable gentleman in moving away from what, on the face of it, I thought was a fairly short answer on Community oil policy, and ending up with a situation about the price of electricity to British industry.
We have deliberately maintained Amendment No 2, although on the face of it, this does not fit logically into the context of our report, but the Commission has indicated to us, Mr President, that we can present the report that this Parliament wants, even if the amend ment is not passed.
In other words, they are preventing the people from expressing their democratic and sovereign will through a referendum and then, with honeyed words, they are throwing up a smokescreen by extolling a so-called 'citizens' initiative', which, on the face of it, will right from the start be subject to many conditions.
On the face of it one might think so, but in fact this is not the case, because every effort is made to ensure that, far from jeopardizing the security of Europe's citizens, the gradual abolition of the frontiers between Member States for individuals of every nationality helps to enhance it.
In reply to the Commission’s first point, the French authorities stated that the reimbursement of incompatible aid could not, on the face of it, be classed as a restructuring cost (or as a contribution by the recipient firm within the meaning of points 43 and 44 of the restructuring aid guidelines).
Looking at the agricultural sector first of all, farmers will receive 37.9 billion ECUs in 1995, not a negligible sum on the face of it, but one which represents, for the first time since the creation of the CAP, less that half of the total European budget, 48.7% to be exact.
In reply to the Commission’s first point, the French authorities stated that the reimbursement of incompatible aid could not, on the face of it, be classed as a restructuring cost (or as an own share of the recipient firm within the meaning of points 43 and 44 of the restructuring guidelines).
According to Ecco, the footwear at issue in the main proceedings, the leather of which makes up 71% of the uppers’ external surface area, should, under Note 4(a) to Chapter 64 of the CN, on the face of it be classified as footwear with uppers of leather falling within CN heading 6403.
Taking de Gaulle's proposals one by one, he wrote: 'If we followed that course we should soon be faced with two methods: the integration method established by the Treaties for the three existing Communities and the method to be adopted for political, defence and education issues will, on the face of it, be different.
BRITTAN, Sir Leon. — There is no question that if an agreement is entered into we will investigate it and investigate it carefully, because it is plainly an agreement which limits competition on the face of it and the only question is whether it is none the less acceptable under Article 85(3) of the Treaty.
This appears reasonable on the face of it but the proposal should be carefully examined to ensure that it would not necessitate the premature scrapping of a vastly expensive piece of transport equipment at a relatively early stage of its normal life because it could not be physically modified at an economic level of cost.
Mr Scrivener (LDR). — (FR) Mr President, we have a draft budget for 1987. On the face of it, and bearing in mind all the difficulties that we have experienced in past years, we are inclined to take joy in the mere fact that this draft has been produced and has come to us for examination.
The evaluation of whether or not the criminal penalties which can be imposed in Member States are sufficiently dissuasive, could on the face of it be affirmative, given the fact that all Member States who have sent information to the Commission have in respect to the conduct referred to in Article 2, provided for a (maximum) imprisonment penalty.
In that connection, it should first be observed that the requirement imposed by the Swedish rules, to the effect that the shares in the transferee must be wholly owned by Swedish companies if a transfer is to be treated as having fiscal effect under the terms of the SIL, appears on the face of it to be discriminatory.
On the face of it, it seems strange that in a situation in which there is general agreement on the approximate equality of value of qualifications needed to enter higher education, and the worth of the highest qualifications obtainable in the system, there should be such difficulty in reaching agreement on the relative value of the intermediate stages.
Where the Office is called upon to give judgment in the context of opposition proceedings, taking such facts or evidence into account is particularly likely to be justified where the Office considers, first, that the material which has been produced late is, on the face of it, likely to be relevant to the outcome of the opposition brought
It is an entirely separate matter whether Vodafone also has grounds to appeal against the CMT’s adopted measure at national level, on the basis, for example, that the CMT made factual errors of assessment which are not apparent on the face of its notification to the Commission, and which the Commission could not have been expected to identify.
However, it will not always be possible for such LCA-based labelling schemes to take proper account of the - on the face of it - reasonable wishes of these countries, since the label's credibility may be at stake if, subject to the reservation expressed in point 4.4.3.4, the environmental requirements in non-product related PPMs are set too low.
However, where, as seems to be the case here, we are dealing with a local network which is usable and is used in practice, and which still has significant intrinsic value and is already depreciated (at least partially), use of the calculation method based on gross replacement cost on the face of it attaches disproportionate importance to investment incentives.
Although, on the one hand, I agree that extending the powers of the Monitoring Centre is, on the face of it, a measure to be welcomed, on the other, I cannot accept the amendments seeking to ensure that the EP is represented by two Members on the Management Board and to increase the number of tools for evaluation purposes.
COLLINS (S), Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. — Mr President, on the face of it, this is a debate about poultry and hatching eggs, and, no doubt, that is why there is a singular absence of people in the Chamber, because, on the face of it, it does not look that significant.
On the face of it, this would be a dramatic advance for consumer interests — and, from industry's point of view, a most unwelcome burden. The Commission has already discouraged any over-dramatic interpretation of the proposed requirement, pointing out in its explanatory note that suppliers would have to make 'appropriate' monitoring arrangements, 'appropriateness being in relation to the risks involved'.
2.10 The Committee of the Regions points out that many of the statistics, which seem on the face of it to be objective and comparable, are in reality highly context-specific, i.e. they are deeply embedded in their own Member State policy frameworks, and these can vary enormously from one country to the next, such as methods of assessing levels of unemployment.
Although on the face of it the judgment gave something to both sides, so that it could be said without too much embarrassment that there were no victors, both the Commission and the insurers in those countries - the great majority - which had argued against the Commission's point of view knew very well that the Commission had suffered a setback.
Nor must you count on my weariness to stop me hammering out evidence which, although on the face of it appears dogmatic, should be blatantly obvious to everyone: The WTO is a machine that should by switched off before it goes any further, instead of carrying on as if there were no problem apart from the stunning failure that was Seattle.
As one goes around the Community now and one talks in various countries about the depth of the crisis and the scale of the crisis and the number of people who are affected by the crisis, it occasionally happens that one hears views which on the face of it seem to imply a particular response to the crisis in a particular country.
Carvalho Cardoso rapporteur's proposed amendments (and allow me to congratulate my colleague Mr Debatisse on his excellent work, only possible thanks to his great competence), I would, nonetheless, highlight three main points: the sudden abolition of consumption aid for olive oil, which may, on the face of it, seem logical but could be counterproductive because of higher consumer prices and, consequently, a drop in consumption.
The suggested extension of the directive to a new swathe of businesses and professions looks on the face of it to be both dangerous and burdensome: dangerous in that there might be a threat to the privileged lawyer/client relationship which is the linchpin of access to justice in a civil society, and burdensome because in theory this directive would now extend to your local high street jeweller.
On the face of it this may appear an academic question in so far as neither the Commission nor the United Kingdom Government denies that the examination which the Court should carry out in order to determine whether Article 47 EU has been infringed must rest on an assessment of the objective and the content of the contested decision in the light of the contested Joint Action.
Accordingly, any decision in this respect must be properly reasoned and must assess, first, whether the material which has been produced late is, on the face of it, likely to be relevant to the outcome of the opposition and, second, whether the stage of the proceedings at which that late submission takes place and the circumstances surrounding it do not argue against such matters being taken into account.
However, on the face of it, the conditions of sale requiring the creation of a committee to protect Austria’s interests and the maintenance of an Austrian core shareholder structure and the requirement to maintain the headquarters of Austrian Airlines in Austria could give rise to concerns with regard to Articles 43, 49 and 56 of the EC Treaty concerning freedom of establishment, freedom to provide services and the free movement of capital.
On the face of it, a number of these subsidies appear to be specific in law or in fact, within the terms of Article 4(2) of the basic Regulation because, in the absence of cooperation from the GOC, they are deemed to be granted to a limited number of steel companies in the encouraged steel sector, and/or because of the manner in which discretion of the granting authorities has been exercised for their granting.
Although, with regard to anti-pollution vessels, we have, on the face of it, nothing against a mutualisation of the cost of providing these, it must be clearly reaffirmed, in regard to the management of these vessels, that the responsibility and the initiative when it comes to preventing and combating marine pollution lies primarily with the coastal Member States and that the Commission must only intervene on a complementary basis by scrupulously and sensibly applying the principle of subsidiarity.
But, as I have indicated to the honourable Member, the Commission feels that it is not itself directly a part of this, and apart from drawing attention — as the House is now doing — to the desirability of a review of the situation, the Commission does not feel — and I personally do not feel — entitled to go any further than to say that this seems on the face of it for the reasons given to be a desirable project and
The question I put to you, Mr Frattini – yes, it is to you that I am speaking – is this: what objective information do you have that leads you to think – and the question is, in truth, also addressed to Mr Schmit – that the blocks placed by the Council on the previous initiative are likely to be removed today, a prospect about which we are, on the face of it, delighted, albeit – it has to be said – slightly sceptical.
GUERMEUR (RDE). - (FR) Mr President, may I first of all congratulate Mr Arias Cañete on the important contribution he has made to the preparatory work on this regulation. On the face of it, people who make their living from the sea and elected representatives of coastal regions, such as myself, ought to welcome a clearly identified financial instrument designed to support struc tural policies in the fisheries sector and to promote improvements in the conditions under which its products are processed and marketed.
Indeed, at a time when the European Union is on its last legs, given that we have twenty million unemployed, where we do not know how to address social problems, especially those which broke out recently in France, and where the citizens' confidence in governments is falling by geometrical progression, the idea of the leaders of the European Union meeting in London in order to discuss the European social model and the resistance to globalisation was, on the face of it, a very good one.
The Committee on Energy, Research and Technology, chaired by Mr Michel Poniatowski, was able to see this at first hand recently when a meeting was held in Greece; we found that one Greek university was operating at exceptionally advanced levels in technologies which we would not, on the face of it, have associated with this country, laser technology and biogenetics, with researchers who had studied in the United States and were maintaining a constant interchange betweeen the expatriate research community, mainly in the United States, and the research community in Greece.
The Commission notes that the mere reference to a limited number of social plans is not enough to demonstrate the existence of a sufficiently established practice in cases comparable to the one at hand, that the redundancy schemes referred to by the French authorities relate to restructuring rather than liquidation plans, and that a large number of these concern sectors which, on the face of it, have nothing in common with transport infrastructure (e.g. the cosmetics industry (Yves Saint-Laurent Haute couture), the agri-food industry (Danone) and the electronics industry (Hewlett Packard)).
Where OHIM is called upon to give judgment in the context of opposition proceedings, taking such facts or evidence into account is particularly likely to be justified where OHIM considers, first, that the material which has been produced late is, on the face of it, likely to be relevant to the outcome of the opposition brought before it and, second, that the stage of the proceedings at which that late submission takes place and the circumstances surrounding it do not preclude such matters being taken into account (OHIM v Kaul, paragraph 44).
Where the Office is called upon to give judgment in the context of opposition proceedings, taking facts or evidence submitted out of time into account is particularly likely to be justified where the Office considers, first, that the material which has been produced late is, on the face of it, likely to be relevant to the outcome of the opposition brought before it and, second, that the stage of the proceedings at which that late submission takes place and the circumstances surrounding it do not argue against such matters being taken into account.
However, the considerations set out in paragraph 43 of the decision of the Board of Appeal do not permit the Court to check that the Board of Appeal actually familiarised itself with the document in question in order to determine whether that document was, on the face of it, likely to have any real relevance in the opposition proceedings. Nor do they permit the Court to verify whether the circumstances of the case and the stage of the proceedings at which that late submission took place preclude that document being taken into account .
What they all have in common is their dependence on support from the pharmaceutical industry – through ads, through support of meetings, and through the purchase of reprints. This is a huge conflict of interest, even on the face of it. Journals have an obligation to report harms as well as benefits of prescription drugs, yet it is only natural that they would be reluctant to bite the hand that feeds them. I would favor eliminating pharmaceutical ads in medical journals altogether; if they want to carry ads, the ads should be for products unrelated to the practice of medicine.
Where OHIM is called upon to give judgment in the context of opposition proceedings, taking facts or evidence submitted out of time into account is particularly likely to be justified where OHIM considers, first, that the material which has been produced late is, on the face of it, likely to be relevant to the outcome of the opposition brought before it and, second, that the stage of the proceedings at which that late submission takes place and the circumstances surrounding it do not argue against such matters being taken into account (OHIM v Kaul, cited in paragraph 27 above, paragraph 44).
