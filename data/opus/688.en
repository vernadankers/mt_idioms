Furthermore I shaped the header pipes (to the mufflers) in opposite directions to prevent that the collector of the rear cylinder ending up in the hot air of the front cylinder. This way, even under very heavy conditions, the temperature difference between both cylinders is limited to a maximum of 15o C, but in some cases, it appears that the rear cylinder is even cooler than the front one.
CRACKS & JOINTS: 'FLEX-FILL' TECHNIQUE 'ÄĘ WORK METHOD The cracks or joints are enlarged by milling with a Klaruw router to a width of 15-20 mm and a depth of 10-20 mm.Following this, the groove is blasted dry and clean using Klaruw's purpose designed SuperJet hot air lance.Immediately after this and while the horizontal and vertical bonding surfaces are still hot, the groove is filled with a flexible sealant, a high-grade filling compound.

"Isostatic presses" (2) mean equipment capable of pressurising a closed cavity through various media (gas, liquid, solid particles, etc.) to create equal pressure in all directions within the cavity upon a workpiece or material. "Laser" (0 2 3 5 6 7 8 9) is an assembly of components which produce both spatially and temporally coherent light that is amplified by stimulated emission of radiation. N.B.: See also: "Chemical laser"; "Q-switched laser"; "Super High Power Laser"; "Transfer laser". "Lighter-than-air vehicles" (9) means balloons and airships that rely on hot air or other lighter-than-air gases such as helium or hydrogen for their lift.
Explore the landscape of Malaga on horseback, on a mountain bike, onboard a pleasure cruiser, overhead in a hot air balloon or paragliding, exploring with a car hire jeep or a big quad, or if you prefer walking, explore the multitude of footpaths in the interior. There are many ways of discovering the Costa del Sol and all of them have their own magic, each of them is the start of a new adventure the secret of which lies in the contrast: the warm seaside sands and the icy mountain snow, the green woodland of the sierras and the arid lowland planes, the traditional white villages and the buzzing metropolis.
"Laser duration" (6) means the time over which a "laser" emits "laser" radiation, which for "pulsed lasers" corresponds to the time over which a single pulse or series of consecutive pulses is emitted. "Lighter-than-air vehicles" (9) means balloons and airships that rely on hot air or other lighter-than-air gases such as helium or hydrogen for their lift. "Linearity" (2) (usually measured in terms of non-linearity) means the maximum deviation of the actual characteristic (average of upscale and downscale readings), positive or negative, from a straight line so positioned as to equalise and minimise the maximum deviations. "Local area network" (4 5) is a data communication system having all of the following characteristics: a. Allows an arbitrary number of independent ’data devices’ to communicate directly with each other; and b. Is confined to a geographical area of moderate size (e.g., office building, plant, campus, warehouse). N.B.:’Data device’ means equipment capable of transmitting or receiving sequences of digital information.
