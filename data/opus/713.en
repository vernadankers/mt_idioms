“ Michael said he would tell me the story of Samson and Delilah, so when I was looking for the story in My Book of Bible Stories, he said: ‘ Samson was a judge, and the judges come before the kings. ’
I know we've inherited some important bits of DNA from our ancestors and as I suggested in my book, what we gained from the sensorium, the insula of the frontal cortices, which is fundamental to our capacity for empathy, isn't just any part.
I said, "The real problems are the older children my uncles, my aunts, my father's sisters, these are the people...my father's brothers-in-law - these are the people who are the trouble. I don't want anybody else to mark my books, underline in my books,

I may well not have had much to say in favour of Friedrich von Hayek in my books and other works, but what I see in this place from one day to another is such a waste of money – not yours, not Parliament’s, but the taxpayer’s – that I have come to think of the whole thing as a hypocritical farce.

Why should you change things? Because the clock is meaningless — we follow it without really realizing why。 We follow it because we’ve been raised to believe we should, and because those who control us (bosses, corporations, schools, etc。) set schedules we must follow。 The clock, then, is a means to control us — and that, in my book, is as good a reason to break free from it as any。
Based on our observations we can make active, purposeful, corrective changes that lead to physiologically calmer breathing and healing in other areas, as I describe in my book "Bijbels Omgaan met Stress Deel 1: Lichamelijke Aspecten" (Biblical Stress Release Part 1: Physical Aspects). Kabat-Zinn insists, however, that you should not strive to influence your breathing in any way, and he uses breathing exercises in a framework of cosmic energizing and chakra healing.
The two tracks that are not sung by mister Tolkki are by far the best songs to be found on here: 'Key To The Universe', which is performed by Michael Kiske (which accounts for the fact that the song quite resembles a laid-back Helloween song) and 'Are You The One?', which is sung by our own Sharon Den Adel and in my book is the highlight of the furthermore very mediocre CD.
I believe that we're going to have, I wrote in my book we would have the threats of deflation followed by big inflation which we have already had, that's what this is, followed by a real monetary deflation which is the collapse of the currency supply: inflation, deflation are properly referred to as an expansion or contraction of the currency supply prices follow but there's a delay, uh... and so uh... consumer price inflation keeps your eye off the ball.
Transformation starts when you start live from your heart and start to stand in your own strength, transformation starts when your way of thinking changes from a brain based conscience to a heart centred conscience, transformation starts when you transform the ego and harmonises and the more coordinate on your true "I".

We're going to talk -- my -- a new lecture, just for TED -- and I'm going show you some illusions that we've created for TED, and I'm going to try to relate this to happiness. What I was thinking about with happiness is, what gives happiness -- or happiness, which I equate with joy in my particular area, and I think there's something very fundamental. And I was thinking about this. And it's in terms of both illusions and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows is that there's something about these things where our expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing way. You go see a movie. And it has an unexpected twist -- something that you didn't expect -- and you find a joyful experience. You look at those sort of illusions in my book and it's not as what you'd expect. And there's something joyful about it. And it's the same thing with jokes and all these sorts of things. So, what I'm going to try and do in my lecture is go a little bit further and see if I can violate your expectations in a pleasing way. I mean, sometimes expectations that are violated are not pleasant, but I'm going to try to do it in a pleasant way, in a very primal way, so I can make the audience here happy.
