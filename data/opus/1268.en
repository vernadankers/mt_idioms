A magnificent tour of the striking Daniel massif. Idyllic stretches in the Neidernachtal, wonderful ride high above the Plansee, alternatively there is a difficult trail along the lakeshore. Swimming possibilities at the Plansee and at the Heiterwanger See.
Did you notice that the oil tankers we saw all ride high on the water, with sections of the rudder and propeller visible?
clouds That ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around the slopes
