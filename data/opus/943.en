Therefore, during the Japanese Middle Ages, in turn merciless and terrible or filled with kindness, depending on the traveler's soul who encountered it on a forest path, it meant hell or the last resort for the lost or the reckless who knew his moment of truth had arrived when he suddenly heard mocking fits of laughter above him in the branches.
We are all aware that a change of speed and perhaps direction even is necessary, that we are at a moment of truth, a time of change, and the President of the Council of the Belgian presidency has given us here, although with a sense of realism, a measure of this same determination to go a bit further than we have done so far.

It also comes, as you have pointed out, on the eve of a highly sensitive meeting of the Convention, at a time when we have spent a lot of time on useful discussions in debates of a general nature about the tasks of the Union, and are on the point of getting down to the heart of the matter, and when we are perhaps approaching a moment of truth.

According to the fabulous stories told among the people, they were famous for their knowledge in Martial Arts, of which they sometimes learned from the humans.
