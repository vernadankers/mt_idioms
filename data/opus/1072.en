Moser) anticipated many results of geometrical abstraction and op art, as did the Viennese kinetism of F. Cizek and E. G. Klien. The dispute centred on people and objects in motion gradually engendered an abstracting geometrical language of forms of squares, circles, rings, discs, lines and points that were used by L. Kassak, L. Moholy-Nagy, B. Uitz and S. Bortnyik as of 1919 in Vienna and Weimar to create Hungarian constructivism, whose vocabulary of forms was soon universalised beyond the two-dimensional surface to embrace three-dimensional space (F. Molnar, L. Peri, M. Breuer, A. Weininger).
