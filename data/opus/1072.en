From the equation (2) it becomes apparent that two parameters are important in defining the centrifugation condition, i.e. time (t) and speed (rpm), in order to achieve separation of particles with a specific size (in our case 0,1 μm radius): (1) the density of the soil and (2) the length of the mixture in the centrifuge tube (Rb-Rt), i.e. the distance which a soil particle covers from the top of the solution to the bottom of the tube; obviously, for a fixed volume the length of the mixture in the tube will depend on the square of the radius of the tube.
We go and see the large church on the square (Catedral-Basílica de Nuestra Señora del Pilar), and we climb the tower (largely by elevator) to admire the view.
As of this weekend, there is a ban on smoking on the square and in front of the affected entrance to the Tinbergen building, at the side of the Pavillion, until a permanent solution has been found.
