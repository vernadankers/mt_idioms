Couldn't we... drop a hint here and there?
You can't drop a hint to our daughter's godfather?
PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO DROP A HINT TO MRS. COUNCILOR NUGENT
Can you drop a hint to Booth about me getting some more fieldwork? What?
So, do you want me to drop a hint the next time i see him?
Michelle, I have been thinking, could we not drop a hint to the Colonel and the Captain?
All this I have said in order to drop a hint, and I hope that the interpreters understand what I mean by that.
Just try to drop a hint now and then as to where you are so we can sort of keep track of you, okay?
However, you know as well as I do that things can be done differently in practice, and that the Council can drop a hint to the Commission that it wants such proposals.
