The result has been that at the end of the day, on the instructions of the Summit, the Commission has had to put before us emergency proposals — I would almost call them — that are of the worst possible kind, taken in haste at a time when we had no alternative but to try and find a solution within the critical situation of budgetary constraints.
look like the first moral principle that emerged from the discussion said that the right thing to do the moral thing to do depends on the consequences that will result from your action at the end of the day better that five should live even if one must die. That's an example of consequentialist moral reasoning. consequentialist moral reasoning locates morality in the consequences of an act.
MIRANDA DA SILVA (CG). - (PT) Mr President, I would first of all like to express my pleasure on behalf of my group with regard to this debate on the current situation in Russia, not only because it gives each group the opportunity to express its position, but also because, at the end of the day, the Council managed to clearly state its position on the matter.
Nonetheless I am glad that the report does address the fact that we, of course, expect common rules - even if for a different reason, namely because of safety aspects -with regard, for instance, to working hours and flight times, because, at the end of the day, it is training and actual working conditions that will partly determine how safe we can make European aviation over the long term.
At the end of the day, we buy and sell in real dollars, yuan or rupees, not their PPP equivalents, and we think market-derived exchange rates will continue to influence stock performance over the short and medium term. Nevertheless, in our view, exercises such as the PPP calculation, as well as the Nigeria GDP rebasing, demonstrate the tremendous strides that have been made by frontier and emerging markets in recent years.
Today, we are essentially witnessing one of many historic moments which those who work in the sector, as well as those who are in favour of trains, have waited for for a long time, because at the end of the day, all this is, of course, meant to culminate in technological harmonisation, which entails the harmonisation of international rail, labour organisations, train drivers who have to make international rail journeys, etc.
I feel that we need to move to a process, to be honest, where we keep the politicians out of this process; where, at the end of the day, maybe the ministers can say 'yes' or 'no' to the solution but cannot actually negotiate it themselves because we are just going to have a situation where the environment is put on the back burner and we are just looking for political victories.
Finally, Mr Barroso, I would like to put one question to you: I would like to know why you did not tell President Sarkozy that the European Union already had a European Neighbourhood Policy and it was entirely unnecessary to invent a new structure: one that, at the end of the day, would be an office of 20 people whose job would be to resolve the problems of the Mediterranean, without any consultation.
Sowers would take out Elezra in 19th place a little bit later when he got it all in with 6-4 against Eli's A-6 on a 6-3-2 flop and hit a 5 on the turn.The professionals dominated the action at the end of the day and by the time we were down to 11 players, Andy Bloch, Patrik Antonius, Mike Sowers, Phil Laak, Mike Sexton, Chris Bell, and Kathy Liebert were all still playing.
Exploring the island by scooter is great, with the wind blowing though your hair (if applicable), because helmets are unheard of. By the way, it is wise to get off the roads at the end of the day, before the drunken Indians hit the road. Diu is ‘famous’ for its freely available and cheap alcohol (in contract with the dry state of Gujarat), making it a popular destination for Indians that want to fill themselves with alcohol.
At the end of the day, every individual Member will have to weigh up for himself and herself the benefits involved in seizing a short-term political and economic opportunity as against taking long-term, indeed geostrategic considerations into account, in particular as to how different cultures are to be integrated into this Union, but you were right to point out that it is we who have to take that decision, and that taking it without the European Parliament is unthinkable.
If they do not, then I think the or the ‘Women on Waves’ organisation ought to write a thank-you letter to the Portuguese Government for giving us the opportunity to discuss the principle whereby women must be able to decide freely when and how they want to receive information on the termination of pregnancy and what they do with it, and, at the end of the day, also have a free choice as to when and how they want to have a child.
We will be ignoring the work being done by our Member States at the United Nations and taking a different approach which is likely to encourage certain countries to exploit religious issues in their international relations. We will be going against the balanced approach recommended, for example, by Mrs Jahangir, United Nations Special Rapporteur, currently under house arrest in Pakistan, and at the end of the day we will also be making the situation of religious minorities throughout the world, including Christians, more fragile.
I therefore ask the Commission, through Mr Millan and Mr Schmidhuber, to coordinate to the fullest extent possible the structural funds and the Cohesion Fund — which, at the end of the day, is another structural fund, for transport and environment infrastructures — so as to try to ensure that the common measures are truly consolidated and coordinated measures, and that the common convergence policies are not mere rhetoric, but a success for the Commission, Parliament and all those involved in this venture of European unity.
During the day, we sailed our way to the "capital" of South Georgia, King Edward Point and Grytviken. With foresail alone, under a brilliant clear sky, where lenticular clouds formed during our trip, we did 7.5 knots as if it where nothing special! At the end of the day, we entered Grytviken, wherfe the immigration officer took our mooring lines. He gave us a briefing on the do's and don't's on the Island, stamped our passports and went home with three fresh lemons and a sheepsleg.
At the same time, though, it strikes me as of the utmost importance that the Commission and the Council, in the course of their negotiations, should bear it in mind - and you can use this as an argument, if you like - that any such agreement must, at the end of the day, be ratified by Parliament and that we will not accept an agreement that does not include certain conditions that are decisive in terms of solidarity between all Member States of the European Union.
Traveled we do not voyage by bus and with some uncles on a minibus that just goes to Lutsk. What I want to say: if you are critical of the time it does not plan Olika the very end of the trip, as well as at the end of the day because you risk not go directly from there, and the nearest slopes - 6 kilometers, as I mentioned. 6 kilometers - it's even briskly for half an hour and still waiting for a minibus or a ride on the highway.
As regards Article 58(1)(a) and (b) of the Rules of Procedure, where a time limit is expressed in weeks, months or years, it shall expire at the end of the day which, in the last week, month or year indicated in the time limit, is the same day of the week, or falls on the same date, as the day on which the time limit began to run, that is the day on which the event which started time running occurred, or the action which started time running took place, and not the following day.
This also applies to cases of non-compliance by a counterparty with: (a) the rules for the use of underlying assets (if a counterparty is using assets which are or have become ineligible, or which may not be used by the counterparty, e.g. owing to close links between, or the identity of, issuer/guarantor and counterparty); and (b) the rules for end-of-day procedures and access conditions for the marginal lending facility (if a counterparty which has a negative balance on the settlement account at the end of the day does not fulfil the access conditions for the marginal lending facility).
( iii ) investment firms referred to in Article 3 ( a )( 1 )( iii ) , on condition that such investment firm submits satisfactory written evidence that : ( a ) either it has concluded a formal agreement with a Eurosystem monetary policy counterparty to cover any residual debit position at the end of the day in question ; or ( b ) access to intraday credit is limited to investment firms which hold an account with a central securities depository , and the investment firm in question is subject to a liquidity deadline or the amount of intraday credit is subject to a ceiling .
Nevertheless, I would like to point out that we attach great importance to this report, as well as to the contributions made by the Commission to improving the international panorama, and we are clearly in favour of multilateralism – as I have said previously – although we believe that the situation puts excessive emphasis on anti-terrorist aspects and does not give sufficient emphasis to better international cooperation aimed at eliminating the causes of inequality and injustice, such as the democratic control by the UN of agencies such as the World Trade Organisation, the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank which, at the end of the day, are the bodies which can create greater justice in the world.
