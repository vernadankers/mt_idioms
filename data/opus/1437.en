Well that's how it should be.

This temptation is often impossible to avoid, yet the fact remains that we have to steer clear of wrapping democracy in too much red tape, as the efficacy of good governance must never mean losing the space for politics, still less abdicating space for politics to quasi-administrative forms such as committees and, sometimes, conferences. This is because, to borrow Mirabeau's expression, these are not a real 'cross-section of the population'.

After the brilliant fourth place on the grid, and pole position in the Pro-Am Cup, everything was being prepared at Blancpain Reiter Engineering for this gruelling 24 hours race. Jos Menten was fully confident just prior to the race: “During the warm-up we checked everything once again, and it all looked pretty good for the race.
