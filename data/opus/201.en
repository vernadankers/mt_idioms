The Belgian prime minister called the institutional component an out-and-out failure, but we in the House - or the majority of us at least - are so polite and kind and diplomatic that we can no longer call a spade a spade, yet within a few months we shall once more be complaining that no one takes us seriously.

However, in tackling the matter of contributions to political parties in the context of combating corruption, we must have the courage to call a spade a spade, to recognise that the democratic contest for power fought by political parties and politicians, given over as it is to the dictates of marketing, advertising and the use of information to manipulate voters, takes vast sums of money which are obtained, for the most part, from generous donations by powerful economic interests.

NORDMANN (LDR). — (FR) Mr President, repetitive though our debate may be on the Lebanese tragedy and particularly on the martyrdom of the Lebanese Christians, we seem to have made some progress because more and more speakers are now daring to call a spade a spade, to call the Syrian aggressor by its name, not forgetting the complicity of the Druse vicepresident of the Socialist International, Walid Jumblat, and to put the debate at political and not merely the humanitarian level.

It papers over the abject failure of Community policy hitherto. In conclusion I would like to sound a note of warning to you and your friends in the following terms: if you intend to use this draft European Act, the so-called 'Perspective for European Union' as an escape route from the difficulties posed by the reform of the Community agricultural sector, or from the contradictory policy you have towards Community enlargement, from resolving the Community's budget ary problems, then you are deluding yourselves and I can assure you that the Socialists will not go down that road with you but will, rather, hold you to your word and we shall not hesitate to call a spade a spade.
