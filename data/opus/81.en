One significant developmenthas been that improvements in the labour market have not led to a short-term increasein inflation as companies put up prices in order to recover the higher wages needed toretain and attract employees.
Although it has not yet enabled the country to rise to the level of the other scientific powers, this increased effort is starting to bear fruit and to produce concrete results, as witnessed in particular by the spectacular rise in the number of Japanese Nobel Prize winners: 4 Nobel Prizes for science over the last four years, whilst the country could only boast of 3 prizes since the award was created.
An initiative which is under con sideration and promises to bear fruit is this socially strategic field, is the proposal which has been given the name IRIS, which is specifically concerned with the application of information technology to all these fields, from health to town planning, from working conditions to the environment, in other words all those areas where the quality of our lives and there fore the very substance of our well-being stand to be affected.
With this in mind it is necessary to use to the full the opportunity provided by the presentation of this White Paper, a policy document analyzing 'problems of education and training which is also relevant for the period of its presentation at a stage when Articles 126 and 127 of the Treaty establishing the European Community have begun to bear fruit and which coincides with the launch of the new Socrates and Leonardo programmes for Community cooperation.
Neither the masters of heaven can reach the end of the glories of You so Unlimited, nor even You Yourself, within whom the multitudes of universes - each in their own shell - with the Course of Time are blown about in the sky as particles of dust; indeed is it because the s'rutis in You bear fruit by [neti neti] eliminating what is not the Absolute, that they in You find their ultimate conclusion [see siddhânta]'.
Mr President, I would also like to stress the need to forge ahead with objectives that facilitate a greater involvement of civil society in creating networks linking cities, ports, universities, trade associations, entrepreneurs and non-governmental organisations, for the INTERREG programmes to be used to promote balanced development with regard to trade and territory through the modernisation of economic structures, so that the MEDA programme, which has received such a disappointingly small amount of funding, can at last bear fruit.
At the end of the prayer, the Bishop of Rotterdam, Adrianus van Luyn, spoke of four gifts received from the Lord, through Taizé, which will surely bear fruit in the coming years: First of all, for the Churches in our country, especially in our diocese: an impulse to continue and to animate the dialogue with the younger generation about the meaning of life, and to strengthen faith, in pastoral initiatives of prayer and reflection, meeting and community, service and solidarity.
I repeat, the Europe we want is a Europe that has greater visibility, a will to act, and the means with which to put this will into practice; it is a Europe that also has the necessary coherence to act, and by this I mean that there must be coherence, within the European Union and in all of its institutions and between the European Union and its Member States so that the entire effort, for example the diplomatic effort, can bear fruit.
As regards the Lisbon Strategy, I must congratulate the Presidency and the Commission on having finally realised what we have been saying for ages: unless the Commission is awarded wider powers and responsibilities within the Lisbon Strategy than it was given in 2000, the Lisbon Strategy will not bear fruit. An appropriate line to take would be to strengthen the Commission's role, making it the pivotal point of the Lisbon Strategy, and we are hopeful that such a fresh approach could eventually bear fruit.
It is He Who sendeth down rain from the skies: with it We produce vegetation of all kinds: from some We produce green (crops), out of which We produce grain, heaped up (at harvest); out of the date-palm and its sheaths (or spathes) (come) clusters of dates hanging low and near: and (then there are) gardens of grapes, and olives, and pomegranates, each similar (in kind) yet different (in variety): when they begin to bear fruit, feast your eyes with the fruit and the ripeness thereof.

And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward: For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall do this.
In this way, these education profes­sionals have rendered rather outdat­ed the comment by G. B. Shaw (1856­1950): 'Those who can, do. those who can't, teach.' cial resources of many education faculties in Spanish universities has been devoted to turning out profes­sionals of this calibre. This forward­looking investment has begun to bear fruit and the current labour mar­ket features a good supply of educa­tionalists with proven skills in analy­sis, problem solving, communication and negotiation able to satisfy work­ers' rights to be informed and con­sulted, to participate in decision­mak­ing and to be trained in risk preven­tion (Article 14.1).
I truly hope that the process we completed in Maastricht, a process of far-reaching discussions and negotiations on how we can make the Community's foreign policy more coherent in future, on how we can speak more often with a single voice, will also bear fruit in the choices we will soon be making on Yugoslavia in close collaboration with the President of the Yugoslavian Conference, Lord Carrington, and the envoys of the United Nations Secretary General who, as you know, have been doing their utmost to prepare the way for the arrival of a UN peacekeeping force in the area.
I am glad that it has been spelled out, both here and at the major conference in Bremen, that HIV/AIDS must go to the top of the agenda, for I am firmly persuaded that it is only if the Heads of State or Government make this issue their own that we will, everywhere, and not least in our neighbouring countries, be able to ensure the creation of the infrastructure that is needed if cooperation with civil society and, above all, with sufferers, is to bear fruit, and if the things to which reference has been made are actually to be done.
4 So, my brothers and sisters, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you could be joined to another, to the one who was raised from the dead, to bear fruit to God.5 For when we were in the flesh, the sinful desires, aroused by the law, were active in the members of our body to bear fruit for death.6 But now we have been released from the law, because we have died to what controlled us, so that we may serve in the new life of the Spirit and not under the old written code.
However, I suspect that it has nothing interesting or progressive to tell us, because the initiatives of the non-governmental organisations, to which the programme mainly refers, cannot bear fruit if there is no public dialogue in the Member States on the subject which will engage the parliaments, national and regional, where they exist, and will bring parties, local authorities and social agencies face to face with their options and responsibilities, in order to make the whole of society aware of the issue of the participation of women, an issue which concerns the future of the whole of society and not just the future of women.
You will be aware that I have no leading role, and that I in no way wish to trespass on my fellow-Commissioners’ provinces, just as they do not interfere in matters within my remit, and so I will say, by way of reply, and with all due caution, that reference is made, in all the Commission documents on the subject of the need for reforms in Europe, to the fact that – in some sectors and in some Member States, at any rate – labour markets are too rigid, too lacking in flexibility, and that more flexibility in the labour markets – albeit always described very precisely in each instance – would indeed bear fruit in the shape of greater entrepreneurial initiative, more willingness to take risks, and, ultimately, to more jobs.
“Or do you not know, brethren (for I speak to those who know the law), that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives? For the woman who has a husband is bound by the law to her husband as long as he lives. But if the husband dies, she is released from the law of her husband. So then if, while her husband lives, she marries another man, she will be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from that law, so that she is no adulteress, though she has married another man. Therefore, my brethren, you also have become dead to the law through the body of Christ, that you may be married to another--to Him who was raised from the dead, that we should bear fruit to God.”
