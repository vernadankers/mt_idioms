The sturdy melodic hardrock and heavy metal from the men always hit the right note with me and they never went wrong in my eyes.
They know exactly when and where to hit the right note so the album completely absorbs you.
I'm just not that charmed with the (semi-)ballads 'Wasting Time' and 'Flames', because although these tracks certainly sound beautiful, they don't manage to hit the right note and "disturb" the album's velocity.
On balance I think that the Commission has hit the right note here.
