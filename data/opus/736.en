First, in all attacks which might be made upon my person, I would determine whether or not the aggressor was a son of God — my brother in the flesh — and if I thought such a creature did not possess moral judgment and spiritual reason, I would unhesitatingly defend myself to the full capacity of my powers of resistance, regardless of consequences to the attacker.
We must do as Peter says in the fourth chapter of his first letter: “Arm yourselves with the same mental disposition [of Christ]; because the person that has suffered in the flesh has desisted from sins, to the end that he may live the remainder of his time in the flesh, no more for the desires of men, but for God’s will. ” — 1 Pet.
The subsequent distortion of Jesus' teachings, as they are recorded in the New Testament, is because the concept of the gospel writers was colored by the belief that Jesus was then absent from the world for only a short time; that he would soon return to establish the kingdom in power and glory—just such an idea as they held while he was with them in the flesh.
In the Old Testament, He made our sins disappear with the blue, purple, and scarlet thread, while In the New Testament, Jesus became our Savior by coming to this earth in the flesh of a man, taking all our sins upon Himself with His baptism received from John, and taking care of all our sins and the judgment of these sin by shedding His blood on the Cross.
Jesus was resurrected, not as a man “a little lower than angels, ” but as a spirit Son mightier than Satan the Great Serpent, because this same Simon Peter tells us:“ Christ died once for all time concerning sins, a righteous person for unrighteous ones, that he might lead you to God, he being put to death in the flesh, but being made alive in the spirit. ”
Rather than claiming to be God in the flesh, Jesus Christ pointed out his dependence upon the Father and his inferiority to him by saying: “I cannot do a single thing of my own initiative; just as I hear, I judge; and the judgment that I render is righteous, because I seek, not my own will, but the will of him that sent me. ” — John 5: 30.
(Matthew 26:39, 42, 44) PAUL: To keep me from being too elated, a thorn was given to me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me, to keep me from being too elated.Three times I appealed to the Lord about this, that it would leave me, but he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for power is made perfect in weakness".(2 Corinthians 12:7-9) 93.
1 John 4:3 And every spirit that confesseth not that YAHUSHUA ha MASHIACH is come in the flesh is not of YAHUVEH: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world. 2 John 1:7 For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that YAHUSHUA ha MASHIACH is come in the flesh.
The acquired spirit identity of the man of Nazareth which was built up during his lifetime in the flesh, first, by the direct efforts of his Thought Adjuster, and later, by his own perfect adjustment between the physical necessities and the spiritual requirements of the ideal mortal existence, as it was effected by his never-ceasing choice of the Father's will, must have been consigned to the custody of the Paradise Father.
Remember this as a weapon against satan, as you continually remind him, satan has no claim on your mind, body, spirit or soul, unless you, through sin, give him the legal right. Be ye Holy as I am Holy, strive to live Holy, in your mind, and body and walk in the HOLY SPIRIT more than you walk in the flesh and know that legions of Heaven's Holy Angels fight in your behalf!
A person convulsing in the flesh can regain control quite easily. If you ask a person if it is God on them or if God is on them because they have a demon, you will know by their reaction - a demon will often speak up at that point with a hate filled response, and if in the flesh a person will look at you like you're crazy to suggest they have a demon.
And during this forty years, the kingdom of God is to be set up (but not in the flesh, ‘ the natural first and afterwards the spiritual ’), the Jews are to be restored, the Gentile kingdoms broken in pieces ‘ like a potter’s vessel, ’ and the kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ, and the judgment age introduced. ” — Three Worlds or Plan of Redemption, pp.
Yet such will have oppression in the flesh, and I want to spare you.29But I say this, brothers: the time is short, that from now on, both those who have wives may be as though they had none;30and those who weep, as though they didn't weep; and those who rejoice, as though they didn't rejoice; and those who buy, as though they didn't possess;31and those who use the world, as not using it to the fullest.
And we must remember that the Messiah came to this earth in the flesh of a man and accepted all our sins passed onto His own body through the baptism that He received from John-that is, whenever we commit actual sins in this world, fall into weaknesses or our weaknesses are revealed, we must remember even more that the Messiah came in the flesh, was baptized and crucified, and thereby has already blotted out all our sins.
And this is eternal life, that my creatures should know you as the only true God and Father of all, and that they should believe in him whom you sent into the world. Father, I have exalted you on earth and have accomplished the work which you gave me to do. I have almost finished my bestowal upon the children of our own creation; there remains only for me to lay down my life in the flesh.
For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh; That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ; In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
Certain phases of mind are continued in the surviving soul; certain experiential values of the former human mind are held by the Adjuster; and there persist in the local universe the records of the human life as it was lived in the flesh, together with certain living registrations in the numerous beings who are concerned with the final evaluation of the ascending mortal, beings extending in range from seraphim to Universal Censors and probably on beyond to the Supreme.
109:6.4 (1200.4) The activities of Adjusters in your local universe are directed by the Personalized Adjuster of Michael of Nebadon, that very Monitor who guided him step by step when he lived his human life in the flesh of Joshua ben Joseph. Faithful to his trust was this extraordinary Adjuster, and wisely did this valiant Monitor direct the human nature, ever guiding the mortal mind of the Paradise Son in the choosing of the path of the Father’s perfect will.
That the doing of God’s will is indeed the “whole obligation of man ” is what Simon Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, wrote to the early Christians:“ Since Christ suffered in the flesh, you too arm yourselves with the same mental disposition; because the person that has suffered in the flesh has desisted from sins, to the end that he may live the remainder of his time in the flesh, no more for the desires of men, but for God’s will.
172:3.2 (1880.8) All morning Jesus had thought about his entry into Jerusalem. Heretofore he had always endeavored to suppress all public acclaim of him as the Messiah, but it was different now; he was nearing the end of his career in the flesh, his death had been decreed by the Sanhedrin, and no harm could come from allowing his disciples to give free expression to their feelings, just as might occur if he elected to make a formal and public entry into the city.
This life in the flesh, together with his death on the cross and subsequent resurrection, presently became a new gospel of the ransom which had thus been paid in order to purchase man back from the clutch of the evil one — from the condemnation of an offended God. Nevertheless, even though the gospel did become greatly distorted, it remains a fact that this new message about Jesus carried along with it many of the fundamental truths and teachings of his earlier gospel of the kingdom.
Almost a year ago — 17 May 1983 — a resolution on human rights in the Soviet Union was adopted (it was in fact a resolution moved by Lord Bethell) which denounced the interference of the Soviet Government in the private, family and domestic lives and correspondence of its citizens, and also called for a stop to the persecution of homosexuals, and the political police tactics of discrediting dissidents by accusing them of immorality and homosexuality. But this practice has, alas ! been used — there was a case only recently — in a Member State of the Community, against someone who was a thorn in the flesh of those in power.
