Tough as old boots.
I'm tough as old boots.
You're tough as old boots, Blacksmith.
Tough as old boots, you are.
She's tough as old boots, that one.
The last lot were as tough as old boots.
Tough as old boots, you and I, aren't we?
He's 80 years old and tough as old boots and you sent me round there to make him cry.
