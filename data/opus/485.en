Now your thinkin' bout it Girl your thinkin' bout it What we got here How we fuckin' got here They recognize They just recognize I'm in a life without a home so this recognitions not enough I don't care bout nobody else Cause I've been on these streets way too long Baby I've been on this too long Cause getting faded too long Got me on this rolling stone So I take another hit Kill another serotonin With a hand full of beans And a chest full of weed Got me singing bout a bitch While I'm blowing out my steam Yea I know I got my issues Why you think I fuckin' flow?
If you were a young fellow full of beans with $100,000 where would you go?
Yeah, no, good as gold, really. She sleeps really well and is full of beans in the morning.
I am a gnome a bag of bones A man of means and full of beans The girls in Spain sing my refrains
I go, "Whoo," and then I'm full of beans for a while.
