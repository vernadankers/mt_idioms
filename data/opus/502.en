I have heard that you want 20% renewable energies with effect from 2012, so go ahead and do that, but then those countries that are unwilling or unable to achieve that - whether they be large or small - must get it in the neck from the European Union.
That way, I'll get it in the neck and not you. Mm-hm.
Frankly, I would prefer our French friends and col leagues not to get all heated up simply whenever something is moved out of Strasbourg, just as I would prefer my Luxembourg friends to act differently and not simply when they get it in the neck yet again, and I would also prefer the President of Parliament not to throw punches in the corridors, but to come and explain his ideas to us instead.
