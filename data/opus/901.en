This craggy, romantic 16th century tower sits just outside the pretty village of Kinvara, and in the early 20th century was a meeting place for some of Ireland's greatest writers, including WB Yeats, George Bernard Shaw and JM Synge. If you have more time Book ahead and make a night of it with dinner and literary readings at the Dunguaire Castle Banquet (seasonal).
Why not make a night of it & amp; eat, too! Ring 01253 352628 for a reserve your table. (Please mention that you said it here!)
"Good night." It was working along into the small hours now, but I thought I might as well make a night of it and finish the thing up, so I rang up an hotel near the Strand.
So you didn't want to make a night of it with the ring-a-ding kid?
