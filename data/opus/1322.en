To scream blue murder and throw me out would have been a kindness compared to five years under your roof, banished from your comfort.
Our environmental organisations would scream blue murder if, in Europe – as happens in countries such as Brazil – whole rivers were to be pumped dry in order to irrigate land, and if hundreds of thousands of hectares of land were to be burned off, with the animals living there having no chance whatever of escaping the flames.
Scream blue murder and get the guards on him in no time.
