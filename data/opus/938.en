Meet your match.
Meet your match, Zorro!
But wait, you may yet meet your match.
I am sure, sir, you will meet your match soon.
- All right. When your name is called, please step up and meet your match.
No ties to any community no one to morn you when you finally meet your match.
I face death in the hope that when you meet your match you will be mortal once more
I face death in the hope that, when you meet your match, you will be mortal once more.
Well, we will talk then, and you will tell me of your God, and you will meet your match, Simon Peter.
