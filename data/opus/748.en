A sales promotion, which required a great deal of effort, but that was also acclaim: 32.000.000 liras for buying a Yamaha XTZ 660 all ready to run in the marathon category, Racing apparel and rest, transport of bike and rider in Paris for the departure and especially transport of spare parts and mechanical assistance in the running, with the ability to have personal sponsors.
This ignores the indisputable fact, as the experience of official organisations and trade unions for workers in the civil aviation industry around the world has shown, that constant reductions in the running costs of aircraft and ground services, together with wall-to-wall privatisation and the private sector' s goal of maximum profit, are the reason for the continuous rise in the number of air accidents.
We also expect the Council to waste no time in approving the directives on the health and safety of workers at the workplace, in improving the policy on families, by introducing parental leave, for example, in developing a housing policy and a population policy and, last but not least, in introducing common principles on workers' rights to a say in the running of their companies.
It is also evident that women, especially wives sharing in the running of a business but working without a partnership agreement or a contract of employment, are very largely absent from the bodies representing the occupations in ques tion, even if the law grants them the right to participate, which is not always the case for wives sharing in the running of a family business.
For us the demand for a new office of vicepresident does not constitute an end in itself. It does express our desire to see our language, a certain democratic culture, that is, the Portuguese culture, and a certain vision of the European ideal, until very recently outside the European democratic debate, brought into a higher administrative body and involved in the running of our Parliament.
Similar powers were granted to the council of the labour armies of the Caucasus and the Ukraine. An army was sent to assist in the construction of a railway in Turkestan, another worked the Donetz coal mines. While Red soldiers helped in the running of industry, those workers who were not called up for military service were conscripted for the "Front of Labour" as explained above.
Alongside Ida, two Polish documentary shorts were also in the running for an Oscar:Joanna, a poignat film by Aneta KOPACZ(and the first Polish film produced by crowdsourcing), and the incredibly movingNasza Klątwa(Our curse), Tomasz ŚLIWIŃSKI’saccount of his son Leo’s rare disease, a report which we helped bring to Brussels as part of the Short Waves festivalin 2014. Unfortunately, they did not manage to win an Oscar.
This is true, if we think of Russia' s plans in the thirties, but at the start of your mandate, a few months ago, you yourself announced at the Conference of Presidents that you would, however, be presenting a legislative programme, or rather, the major policy lines of the European government of which you are head and in the running of which we are engaged today.
Finally, we hope that these elections, with seven candidates in the running, will produce a clear result and establish a clear and democratic president because if they do not — and there are already signs that they will not — there are grave fears that the military will take advantage of the power vacuum which will be created. I believe we have to act to prevent that.

Anyone who would give up running in the same room with a desktop computer such as a voltage source 3000 - 10000V, or Tesla transformer, and let him continue in action for some time ("sparking"), can be almost certain, that the computer reboots in a maximum of 10 minutes and without shutting down the high voltage source will be hardly possible to continue the PC in the running.

By these questions, the national court seeks essentially to ascertain whether Articles 3(g), 5, 52, 58, 59, 85, 86 and 90 of the Treaty preclude a Member State from allowing only non-profit-making private operators to participate in the running of its social welfare system by concluding contracts which entitle them to be reimbursed by the public authorities for the costs of providing social welfare services of a health-care nature.

It was also the space where for the first time you saw compare the different ways of understanding Painting military, represented by Battle of Magenta Jerome Induno and homonymous painting by Giovanni Fattori, then still in the running after the victory in the competition Ricasoli. This context causes of conflict at the time of the medals of merit, so much so that some of the artists awarded, as Abbati, decided to reject.
Forgetting for a moment our fundamental opposition to any kind of interference by the public authorities in the running of undertakings, while it may be quite natural that aid should be given to undertakings in sectors undergoing restructuring, as in the case of shipbuilding and steel, it is obvious that by giving aid to undertakings and sectors that are chronically making a loss, one limits the competitive opportunities of the remaining healthy units.
A Bulldozer blade with a special angle pushed under a mine and drove it to the side of the road.Previous versions, the T4 and the T4E1, with a diagonal blade in a flat angle were no success and were not further developed.The V-shaped blade of the T5 had also a curved edge on top of the blade to prevented mines from toppling over the blade and fall in the running path of the tank.

The Commission’s proposal for a directive onthe reception of applicants for asylum provides anentitlement for any adult family member of theapplicant to be informed in private of their rightto make a separate application; specifies greatercontrol by women in the running of accommodation centres; ensures basic training for authoritiesand other organisations implementing the directive with respect to the needs of both female andmale applicants; and insists upon sex-desegregat-ed data in relation to persons who apply for or aregranted asylum.
There are two interpretations that may be applied to the use of revolutionary terror; on the one hand, it may be aimed against counter-revolution, on the other it may be used to compensate for the regimes declining popularity. As Emma Goldman wrote in 1922, "..an insignificant minority bent on creating an absolute State is necessarily driven to oppression and terrorism" (12). The policy of revolutionary terror is in direct opposition to obtaining mass participation in the running of the society.
Nevertheless, we are surprised that the Miranda report, while deploring the extremely incomplete nature of the information contained in the revenue and expenditure account and financial balance sheet of the Committee of the Regions and the absence of a consistent staffing policy, did not choose to do the same for that institution. Yet certain irregularities in the running of the Committee of the Regions were brought to light in the Court of Auditors' annual report for the 1996 financial year.
I would also like to point out to you that at the moment a number of years are being investigated by the EAGGF, and if deficiencies in the running of the market organisation system are determined in these spot check investigations, then Spain must be prepared for the fact that a lump sum penalty may be incurred, i.e. that the support payments already paid out are reduced in retrospect by a lump sum - according to the gravity of these deficiencies.
According to the authorities the statement warrants an approach according to which a distinction should be drawn between ‘costs that have been incurred in the running of the company and costs that have been imposed on the Company, but which have not been incurred in the normal course of the Company’s budget’. The authorities consider that compensation for the latter costs does not amount to an economic advantage but compensates merely for a structural disadvantage which its competitors do not have.
The meeting took place on 25 November 1998 at the Commission’spremises in Brussels.In the course of the meeting, the Commission services responsible explained the procedure followed in the running of competitions, and in particular, the way corrections were made and supervisedby the Selection Board.Taking into account the guarantees provided for bythis procedure, and the limitations imposed by the caselaw of the Community courts, it was suggested that there were sufficient elements toexclude any potential maladministration in the work of the Selection Board.
In his opening speech the Chairman of the Committee, Mr VANNI, pointed out that by inviting representatives of economic and so.cial interest groups in the Nine and in Greece, Spain and Portugal to hold a joint discussion on the complex issues of enlargement, the Committee had demonstrated its desire to carry out within the framework of the Community Institutions, its role as the vehicle for the democratic and pluralistic involvement of economic and social interest groups and their representative bodies in the running of the Communty.
In paragraph 61 of that judgment, which concerns the taxation of cooperatives, the Court states that in the light of special characteristics peculiar to cooperative societies, it must be held that producers' and workers' cooperative societies cannot, in principle, be regarded as being in a comparable factual and legal situation to that of commercial companies — provided, however, that they act in the economic interest of their members and their relations with members are not purely commercial but personal and individual, the members being actively involved in the running of the business and entitled to equitable distribution of the results of economic performance.

The Authority is of the opinion that the qualification of a cooperative as truly mutual would also depend on a number of other factors, such as the frequency of contacts between the cooperative and the members; the active involvement of the members in the running of the cooperative; the active involvement of the members in the management and decision making of the cooperative; the non-automacy of membership in the cooperative, but active application and approval from existing members; large part of the bonuses paid to members in proportion to the profits; large parts of benefits reserved for members in comparison to benefits for clients that are not members; etc. In the view of the Authority, an assessment of whether a cooperative is genuinely mutual would have to take into account these and similar criteria.
Four principles have emerged from the Commission's internal debate: — the principle of simplification: since the legal status of the employer does not play a key role In Industrial relations, a possible scenario might entail only the establishment of general overall frameworks at European level, which could be developed and fleshed out by Member States if they wished ; — coherence of Community law and European social policy: although the Community has adopted general legal rules concerning employee information and consultation at transnational level and specific rules concerning employee information and consultation at national level, problems are caused by the lack of a general framework on information and consultation at national level; — strength and specific content of the rules: pointing to the fact that initiatives aimed at establishing employee Information and consultation rules at European level have been almost totally successful, while measures to expand the traditions and practices of employee involvement to Community level have failed, the Commission wonders whether or not a solution along the lines of the 'European Works Council' Directive might have the most chance of success; — generality of the Community rules: the Commission considers that this new approach will ensure the harmonious operation of the internal market while enhancing the protection of European employees and increasing their involvement in the running of the
