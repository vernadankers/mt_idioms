==Government==The head of the city government in Montreal is the mayor, who is first among equals in the City Council.
This applies in particular where a Governor is first among equals between colleagues with equivalent voting rights or where such other members may have to deputise for the Governor .
In conclusion, the real message that must emerge from GÃ¶teborg before all others - the first among equals of messages - should be clearly addressed to the candidate countries, and say: we are ready to do business.
