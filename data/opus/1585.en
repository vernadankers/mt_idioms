As for what we will say on 21 May, we can discuss human rights under the essential elements clause of our Agreement, we will certainly discuss for the first time this summer rules of origin - that is already on the agenda - but I want to be scrupulous in sticking to the letter and the spirit of our Agreement.
If the situation is allowed to continue like that, and if there is no thought of a return to the letter and Spirit of the Treaties, I see no way open to the European Parliament of successfully fighting for its right to represent the peoples of Europe and to have its voice heard in that capacity, other than by informal channels.
(c) all infringements, as defined in Annex III, detected during the six months period, including for each infringement the flag of the vessel, the identification code, the date, time and location of the inspection and the nature of the infringement; Member States shall indicate the nature of the infringement by references to the letter under which there are listed in Annex III;
The Prize is intended to reward commitment, activities or achievements in the following sectors : the development of East-West relations in relation to the Helsinki Final Act and, notably, cooperation in the humanitarian and other fields; protection of the freedom of scientific enquiry; defence of human rights, respect for international law and government practice in relation to the letter of the constitution.
If we were to follow the great director’s logic to the letter, we would be eager to demolish the Kalemegdan Fortress in Belgrade, the Ćele kula in Niš [the Tower of Cranes built by the Ottomans in the aftermath of a Serbian uprising of 1804], Baščaršija [Sarajevo’s Ottoman bazaar] or the Austro-Hungarian brasserie in Sarajevo. Why we could even dismantle the Zagreb Cathedral!
Given that the two largest states of the euro zone, France and Germany, have remained in contravention of the stability pact for years on end without finding the necessary inner strength to enact essential reforms, it is imperative that we, in this current phase involving the entry of Member States with a derogation, fulfil the conditions of the Maastricht Treaty to the letter.
In the light of that case-law, the Commission's assessment at points 95 and 96 of the contested decision, which is also consistent with point 22 of the guidelines on aid to employment and points 3.5 and 4.17 of the guidelines on national regional aid, is not contrary to the letter or spirit of Article 87(3)(a) EC and thus does not err in law.
Certain legal authors reject outright the doctrine of the acte clair as being con­trary to the letter of Article 177, a source of abuse and in any event impractica­ble, on the ground of the difficulty for a national court of ascertaining the real meaning of a law based on a number of national laws and expressed in several language versions, each of them authentic.
The Commission needs to be on the alert to ensure that European competition laws are complied with to the letter, so that we can prevent the large multinationals from abusing their dominant position on the market by artificially depressing prices to start with, in order to oust small producers, and then creating cartels and increasing prices, so that they become very expensive to European consumers.
According to the letter writers, the work of the Dutch Safety Board (OVV) and the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) is not 'independent and unconvincing'.They have turned to Trump because the new US President has in the past shown that he attaches more value to the Russian denial that the MH17 was shot down with a Buk missile than to the detailed investigation of the JIT.
In their responses to the letters sent by the Commission, the Member States confirmed their concerns about the difficulty of applying the current text of the Directive in the health sector and were in favour of postponing the deadline for transposition so that the Commission, during this period, can present amendments which allow MRI to be maintained and developed whilst ensuring the health protection of workers.
van Dijk (V), rapporteur. - (NL) Madam President, I think that if the statement by the Commission is reported to the letter in the Minutes and Report of Proceedings of today's sitting, I can recommend that the House should accept it; in my view, it is then no longer necessary to adopt the amendment concerning whisky, which in any event was not tabled at first reading.
As regards the alcohol monopoly — which concerns ethyl alcohols ofagricultural and non-agricultural origins and wine spirits for use in the makingof port wine1— the comments presented by the Portuguese Government inreply to the letter of formal notice dated 27 December 1988 allowed the Commission to conclude that Portugal has not to date adopted any specificadjustment measures in accordance with Article 208 of the Act of Accession.
In exceptional circumstances, a second person may nevertheless be authorised to present oral argument where the nature or specific complexity of the case warrants this, provided a duly reasoned application to this effect has been submitted in the reply of the party or interested person concerned to the letter of notice to attend the hearing and, in any event, at least two weeks before the actual date of the hearing.
We wish to implement that reform to the letter and, I might add, to ensure that the funds are used judiciously in all areas: the agricultural sector, the Structural Funds as such, and all other areas of Community policy. A growing number of citizens and national parliaments are becoming agitated at the findings of reports by the Court of Auditors, which reveal some instances of poor management or even mismanagement.
In its response of 27 August 2014 to the letter of 14 February 2014 of the Commission regarding the simplification of VAT own resources inspections, Slovakia requested authorisation from the Commission to use a fixed percentage of the intermediate base for the calculation of the VAT own resources base for transactions referred to in point 10 of Annex X, Part B to Directive 2006/112/EC for the financial years 2014 to 2020.
Because they did that to the letter, billions of souls—many of whom benefitted from the extra help provided in the council’s plan—attained their goal to complete third density karmic lessons and evolve into fourth. However, their refusal to honor the second part of their agreement consigned them to the basest layer of Nirvana, where they feel the very same emotional and physical pain they caused to all others after the “cut-off” time.
In its response of 30 April 2014 to the letter of 14 February 2014 of the Commission regarding the simplification of VAT own resources inspections [3], Latvia requested authorisation from the Commission to use fixed percentages of the intermediate base for the calculation of the VAT own resources base for transactions referred to in points 2 and 10 of Annex X, Part B to Directive 2006/112/EC for the financial years 2014 to 2020.

By letter dated 26 October 2000, registered as received on 27 October 2000, the Italian Permanent Representation to the European Union forwarded to the Commission a letter from the Italian authorities in which they stated, in answer to the letter of 6 October 2000 announcing the initiation of the procedure pursuant to Article 88(2) of the Treaty, that they had suspended the arrangements for the grant of financial resources referred to in Law No 39.
Why has the Commission, in accordance with the spirit and purpose behind Article I-5 of the Constitution for Europe, not yet considered the possibility of holding technical discussions, along the lines of the established European ‘conciliation’ procedure, with a three-member delegation designated by the Greek Government, regarding those provisions of the ‘primary shareholder’ law with which it disagrees before sending off a reasoned opinion in reply to the letter from the Greek Government of 6 April 2005?
According to the letter of KPMG titled ‘Project RING — procedures for the submission of a final offer’, sent to the interested investors on 17 October 2013, the tenderers providing proof of secured financing for the price included in their indicative offers would be granted full access to an electronic data room, they could participate in a meeting with the management of NBG, and they would receive the opportunity to participate in a structured question and answers process.
One author has pointed out that with the ACP States, the privileges and immunities were more limited than the usual diplomatic privileges and immunities since they were granted 'solely in the interests of official du ties'. This would suggest that no protection is given to diplomats in their private lives but, in practice, this provision is not enforced to the letter (E. Sauvignon, 'Les Communautés européennes et le droit de légation actif, Revue du Marché commun, 1978, p. 176).
The Belgian authorities, in their reply to the letter initiating the procedure, demonstrated that, under Belgian law, SNCB’s commitment to converting debts into capital was firm as from 7 April 2003, the time of the conclusion of the framework agreement, and the fact that this commitment was subject to a condition precedent, that is to say notification to the Commission and approval by the Commission, did not have the consequence of removing the firm and definite nature of this commitment.
The Commission in its draft regulation, the Com mittee on Research in its opinion, and Mr Casini in his report, are in entire agreement on our aims: to give the JRC a new lease of life. To do so, we have to renew the staff who are the driving forces in the centre, and in doing so, to satisfy the material wellbeing, the professional standing and the dignity of the staff concerned with due regard to the letter and the spirit of the Treaties.
There are only two possible approaches here: either you play at being Santa Claus and say 'all foreigners are welcome in Europe and can be supported by us', or you must apply the existing agreements to the letter, in which the case the asylum cheaters must be sent back to their own countries: not just because they put the whole asylum system at risk and thus harm genuine asylum seekers, but also because in Europe itself there are many poor and underprivileged to whom we first owe an obligation before we can take all the suffering of the world on our shoulders.
1. the place or point where you got access to the system, 2. how much it cost and how you paid to have your letter taken, 3. how the letter was sorted from other letters going elsewhere in the world, 4. method by which the letter got to the airport/sea port before its onward journey across Europe, 5. the vehicle by which the letter crossed Europe, 6. what happens to the letter on its immediate arrival in Athens, 7. the systems needed to then take the letter and deliver it to your friend, 8. at each stage of the journey write down two different jobs involved in the transport of the letter, 9. the approximate time for the letter to arrive.
Allow me to voice the view of the absolute majority of the committee by saying that this is not only a matter of the rights of Parliament, important though they may be; one of the roles in which this Parliament has always seen itself is as the advocate of fundamental rights, of civil liberties, of personal rights in the European Union, and it is difficult to serve as the advocate of the European people if we are excluded in this way from Council projects, an exclusion which we believe is contrary to the letter of the Treaty; no doubt we shall have to agree to differ once again on that point, but in any event our exclusion is entirely contrary to the spirit of the Treaties.
Shortly after release, iOS 11 was determined to drain batteries faster than the previous version.There was a crazy bug that autocorrected the letter i to the letter a.There were many numerous performance issues, freeze-ups and failures that had to be immediately addressed in iOS 11.1 and six minor updates over a period of six weeks.There were virtual keys that did not work when the iPhone X got cold.More than two dozen security issues had to be addressed in iOS 11.2 and iOS 11.311.2 was released to address Spectre. Ok, everyone had to release a patch to deal with Spectre.Then 11.2.5 (skipping over 11.2.3 and 11.2.4) which introduced new features also introduced a bunch of new bugs, most notably a severity having to do with a character from the Indian Telugu language that would crash the device so bad you’d have to do a reset.
As regards the alleged failure to reply to the letters sent to DG XVII on18 and 21 November 1997 by the complainant in case 1152/97/OV,the Ombudsman noted that a reply was sent by the Commission on28 April 1998.In this letter, the Commission first apologised for thelate reply.The Commission then answered the different questionsraised by the complainant.It explained the reasons why the Windfarm Project had received Community funding, namely that it had beenconsidered as a dissemination project, and that the Regulation foresees no specific criteria regarding the size of the beneficiaries of thegrant.The Commission also indicated the names and addresses ofthe promoters of the project to which the payments of the grant weremade.With regard to the request for a copy of the application formsubmitted by the promoters, the Commission drew the complainant’sattention to the provisions of the model contract which limit the Commission’s right to pass confidential information on to third parties.
After a comprehensive assessment of the evidence, the Court ruled that the refusal of the German sole distributor, Melchers & Co., tosupply a German agent could be explained only by efforts on the part of the formerto impede the export to France of the goods ordered. This circumstance pointed toa concerted practice between Melchers & Co. and the French sole distributor,MDF, which had complained on many occasions about cheap parallel imports intoits appointed territory.4 The written request made by the British sole distributor,Shriro, to its main customers not to resell Pioneer equipment in France wasregarded by the Court as direct evidence of a concerted practice by Shriro and MDFwhich had as its object a restriction of competition within the common market. Thefirms' response to the letters in question and the ensuing effects on the market wereimportant only in regard to the gravity of the infringement.5 Furthermore, the Court considered there was proof of Pioneer's participation inboth concerted practices, which were closely connected in respect of both timingand substance.
