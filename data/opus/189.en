I hope that, once the report is approved, we can find a permanent way to address the structural costs of remoteness in the marketing of some fisheries products from these regions which, as you know, are by and large far off, remote and fragmented, where natural energy is scarce and where there is a high dependence on the outside world.
By and large, we agree with the proposals made by the rapporteur, but we added one element to these proposals that the rapporteur unfortunately rejects, namely to take into account the level of noise at night and the level of noise during the day/night/evening, which are two extremely important indicators of noise pollution which allow us to differentiate between charges.
As someone who has spent 28 years in local government education and administration in Britain, I am the very last person to want to see everything run from Brussels and I believe that education should by and large be administered as locally as possible consistent with efficiency and this can often mean at local level rather than even at national level.
The Commission's analysis of the existing obstacles to mobility was by and large confirmed in an opinion given by the Economic and Social Committee on 27 February (5), in an opinion given by the Com mittee of the Regions on 12 March (6), in a resolution adopted by Par liament on 13 May(7), in various national reports drawn up by the
Although united in their desire to establish a link between Eureka (-» point 2.1.47)1and the Community, members were divided when it came to the vote and finally rejected the Ford report, which by and large endorsed the French Eureka pro­ject for coordinating European research, because of a Socialist amendment ruling out any Community participation in the American Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI).
Pressure brought to bear by the Commission, the Eurosystem and the Member States in support of virtually immediate adaptation of cash dispensers to the euro ‑ a sine qua non for a rapid transition – has by and large proved successful: in ten of the twelve Member States between 80% and 100% of cash dispensers will dispense euros from 1 January 2002.
By and large, we have two standpoints, that of the Council which persists in wishing to fund the new requirements of Kosovo and Serbia from the budget total established in Berlin without revision, and that of the Commission which is proposing to revise the financial perspective in order to finance these new requirements without seriously affecting the other policies, particularly the MEDA programme.
I would therefore ask our Danish friends not to use this pretext — because one can always find a pretext somehow — to block this important vote, which is a genuine milestone in European agricultural policy, and thus put the Council into a position where it cannot put into effect at the right moment provisions which it has by and large agreed to accept.
We therefore by and large support these reports, while stressing that sufficient consideration should be given to the importance of the agricultural sector, and in particular to the caution which must be exercised in allowing further surface irrigation, the need for an appropriate transitional period and the increase in the number of products qualifying for the interventions which maintain Community preference at its maximum level.
There is not unanimity, but I think it is a fair assessment to say that by and large there was a recognition that it was an important set of conclusions, and I am encouraged by what I see as a shared sense of commitment by all three institutions - Parliament, the Council and the Commission - to join forces in order to pull Europe through the crisis.
In brief those five priorities are to aim at better invest ment; to develop a common approach to pricing and taxing; to establish measures to avoid destabilizing the market; to reinforce research, development and technology; and to promote a more common approach in our external energy relations: Those are the five priority items the Commission has put to the Council, which, by and large, they have accepted.
As regards the preparation of the list of candidates provided for in Article 21 of the ECHR, it should be considered whether this should be left to the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe or whether a formula should be sought which, while maintaining by and large the existing procedures, guarantees an appropriate degree of participation by the European Parliament in the nomination of the 'Community candidates'.
It is therefore difficult to avoid the conclusion that the capitaldeepening in the EC and the loss of investment efficiency since 1973 by and large represent the response of the enterprises to the rapid rise in direct and indirect labour costs (including social security contributions) and to emerging labour market rigidities which have entailed an increase in the (invisible) costs of labour related to hiring, firing, training, etc.
As a result of the strict licensing rules which have now been introduced for plant protection products in the EU, and thanks to the substantial and costly efforts made by agriculture, advisory services and industry, it is by and large possible in the European Union to abide by the overall precautionary limit value for ground water of 0.1 micrograms per litre of active substance used in plant protection products.
Of course, I do not expect anything better from the Socialists because, by and large — not all of them, so I must make distinctions — they are the ene­mies of the farmer and they would try to eliminate him if possible in order to achieve their great socialist world which, of course, we have seen some examples of in different parts of the world as well as the grave consequences.
A glossary with extra Steuckerian neologisms is added at the end of the text. (**)By and large, the division of this essay into 'question paragraphs' (with tentative 'answers' provided in their motto subtitles) reflects the original organization of Chapter I of Europa Part II (which is the written version of an interview).Some adjustments have been made to allow for a quick grasp of the basic principles of Eurasianism by all interested readers.
The Kingdom of Sweden does not dispute the Commission’s claims that, by and large, beer is a domestic product and wine an imported product; that different methods are used to determine the level of tax to which the two products are subject; or, finally, that the products are to some extent in competition with each other. 9 According to Sweden, however, the products are not completely interchangeable, and it is not clear which categories of wine and beer are in competi-
We shall face difficult problems in February, because I cannot at all see, when our governments have shown themselves in no way willing or able at the last summit to reach agreement on any point at all, I do not see how everything can be resolved in February, unless it is by means of a compromise which is very far removed from the Delors proposals, which we have again endorsed in the past few days and which our groups by and large still endorse.
The Commission proposal, on which the Committee delivered a by and large favour able opinion in October, deals with four different areas: expansion of the scope of Community rules for inland-waterway combined transport; extension of the liberalization zone around inland waterway ports for initial and final road sections of combined inland waterway transport operations (from 50 km to 150 km); facilitation of the final road-haulage operations in own-account combined transport; and finally certain exemptions from the ban on movement applicable to conventional road transport.
We have to resort to experimental methods to answer this, and so what we can do is actually bring people into the lab and disgust them and compare them to a control group that hasn't been disgusted. It turns out that over the past five years a number of researchers have done this, and by and large the results have all been the same, that when people are feeling disgust, their attitudes shift towards the right of the political spectrum, toward more moral conservatism as well.
If we add to this presence - or perhaps we should call it an 'occupation' several more Palestinian refugees, who are by and large poor and poorly integrated into Lebanese society, constituting around 3.5 million people, and the presence in the country's parliament of Hezbullah, the extremist movement - since it cannot be called anything else - it is easy to understand Lebanon's delicate situation, to which the Union must be attentive and in which it must play a moderating role in order to achieve peace, security and development.
It is for this reason that we greatly appreciate this communication and I would indeed like us to use this debate as well to urge the Council to arrive at an agreement on the legal basis before the first reading on 17 July, otherwise we demonstrate an inability to act for and to have faith in Europe's citizens, in that we make statements and then, by and large, behave quite differently - even if it does not depend on us but on the Council; in short, the European institutions say one thing and then do another.
