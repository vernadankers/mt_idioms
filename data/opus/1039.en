The cards used after the move to the Prinsengracht depict Löw yet in another way.Here there are two different drawings on the cards: one of the building (just as the buildings at the addresses on the Heerenstraat and the Heerengracht were previously depicted on some of the earlier cards), and one of the studio, featuring a bearded male photographer standing behind the camera.
Taking stock, it is now clear that the boundaries of expansion have been reached: neither Turkey, nor the former republics of the Soviet Union, such as Georgia and the Ukraine, nor Russia itself may be led to believe that membership of the Union is on the cards during the next 20 years or so. While this is common knowledge, it is not spoken openly.
I fear that if we were to take the option of establishing a right of veto, which is still on the cards, we would ultimately be shooting ourselves in the foot, for this would ultimately reduce the European area - which is, in fact, the largest or one of the largest common markets in the world - to a mere collection of national interests.
A little typo on the playing cards is not that bad, but it is very cumbersome that the starting positions of the players is not printed on the cards themselves and has to be looked up in several different places in the rules. x It seems like there are always two players that are going strong, and one or two players that are struggling.

I am bound to say that the agenda that was tabled in June, in relation to which there was special cooperation with Parliament and with the rapporteur of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mrs Van Lancker, accurately describes the measures and actions relating to social policy under the Treaty, but it also categorically states that the harmonisation of social polices is not on the cards.
– Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that today’s meeting was always on the cards because, when we debated the previous directive, we admitted that, as regards the definition of eligible assets for the investment of undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS), we needed to adapt to the modern world and that the last text we adopted was, in that regard, not exactly ideal.
EPHREMIDIS (CG). — (GR) Mr President, for us in the Left Unity Group, if Helsinki I granted the peoples of Europe a breathing space, and peoples worldwide too, in a period when the cold war was persisting and a world scale disaster was on the cards, Helsinki II, together with the Paris Conference, in our opinion will create the likelihood — which already exists in fact — of a sizeable leap forward.
That is, incidentally, not my fault; I could have settled the matter in April, but at that time the majority in the Committee on Budgetary Control and consequently here in the House was of the opinion that an assembly which was so close to an election should not take such a serious decision as that which was on the cards and that we must wait for the newly-elected assembly, which might hold a different view.
But if I tell you that I was surprised to read in the 3 December issue of Het Parool that yet another referendum is on the cards, this time in conjunction with the plan of privatising GVB, the Municipal Transport Company, you in turn shouldn't be surprised at my rallying cries to all my fellow citizens to say no, with the additional advice to the electorate of not bothering to bone up on the subject matter.
If creating a space where you and your family and friends can get together to play some poker has always been a dream of yours, you'll be happy to know that with the availability of fold up poker tables it may not be as difficult, or expensive as you thought it would be.

Though a global increase in transport pricesmay be on the cards,the biggest change willnonetheless be in price structure.In its earlier White Paper on a common transport policy the Commission already concluded that ‘one of theimportant reasons why imbalances andinefficiencies have arisen is because transport usershave not been adequately confronted with the fullcosts of their activities ...As prices do not reflect thefull social cost of transport,demand has beenartificially high.If appropriate pricing andinfrastructure policies were to be pursued,theseinefficiencies would largely disappear over time.’
