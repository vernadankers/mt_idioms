Keep your eye on the ball next time, okay?
Keep your eye on the ball and become the greatest cricket fielder ever.
Keep your eye on the ball and swing through it.
Keep your eye on the ball because those who seem of the light may not be and those who seem to be serving the Illuminati may, in fact, surprise you.
Okay. Keep your eye on the ball and have fun.
Look forward. So, Julian, I expect you'll keep your eye on the ball at the Lyritrol conference...
