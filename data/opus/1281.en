Mr Craxi's optimism did not prevent Mr Delors this morning from giving us to understand that in the matter of the budget we have remained at rock bottom, particularly as regards own resources and agricultural expenditure, which, at this point, must be directly covered — we do not understand how — by national con tributions still to come.

A record to be thrown in the camp fire, to recall the promising opening track 'Hang'n'Over', in which the banjo introduction works well to conjure up the desired stoner / cowboy atmosphere.In this track the contrast with the rolling drum fills and heavy guitar riffs works surprisingly well.But the effect is immediately nullified with the following Offspring rip-off 'This is the Day' and the record continues to spiral downwards until it reaches rock bottom with the aforementioned atrocity.

Hundreds of thousands of readers of The Ridercherish the word. Maarten Ducrot confessed, when he was still a professional rider: ‘Whenever I hit absolute rock bottom I always think of those immortal words from The Rider by Tim Krabbé – Battoowoo Greekgreek– and everything seems just fine again’. So the word has prospered pretty well for a modest random word. About time to examine if it is random at all! But first I want to stress that the result of this examination could, of course, never harm the magical, almost divine quality of the word.
The amendments proposed by the rapporteur of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development are an improvement on the Commission's proposal, although they too fail to break away from the thinking behind the Regulation or address the basic worries of olive producers and the olive oil market, such as the abolition of intervention, the unaccountability and profiteering of the industry and the multinationals, the low quotas and the extortionate coresponsibility levies, that is, the disastrous consequences of Regulation No 1638/98, which have caused the olive oil market to collapse, prices to hit rock bottom and incomes to evaporate for olive producers, all of whom are small or medium-sized farmers in barren and island regions.
