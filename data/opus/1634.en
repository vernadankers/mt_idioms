… ‘A Game of You’ shows that we reveal ourselves through our behaviour, both consciously and unconsciously, but it also shows that leaked information to be illegible, at least in any objective sense. In asking us both to judge and be judged, it is judgement itself that comes under the microscope and proves, precisely as the title implies, an exercise in subjective projection.
A neuron under the microscope is very elegant with little things sticking out and little things over here, but when you start to put them together in a complex system, and you start to see that it becomes a brain, and that brain can create intelligence, what we're talking about in the body, and cancer is starting to model it like a complex system.
Nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) is a type of head and neck cancer that starts in the epithelial cells that line the surface of the nasopharynx, the upper part of the throat behind the nose and near the base of skull. 1 There are three types of NPC, based on how the cancer cells look under the microscope: keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, non-keratinizing differentiated carcinoma, and undifferentiated carcinoma.
If we think about research as killing an animal, laying it on the dissecting table, cutting it open, and putting it part by part under the microscope, then indeed it is not only extremely impious but also utterly impossible to make the living God an object of research: we cannot catch and kill him. [Note: unless, of course, he becomes man and does not try to escape death.]

As he proceeded to fill a small bottle with the water for the purpose of examination under the microscope, he dilated, with more enthusiasm than discretion, to an uncultivated son of the plough who stood close by, upon the hidden and innumerable wonders contained in the pool, and concluded by saying, ‘’Yes, my friend, within this pool is contained a hundred, nay, a million universes, had we but the sense or the instrument by which we could apprehend them.” And the unsophisticated one ponderously remarked, "I know the water be full o’ tadpoles, but they be easy to catch.”
As she explained, "The host remained submerged in water for a long time, and then was left on the corporal.Therefore the tissue should have undergone the process of 'asphyxia' [dying out], but we did not observe any such changes during our tests … according to the current state of knowledge in biology, we cannot explain this phenomenon scientifically."Also very intrigued by the way the heart tissue was connected to the consecrated host, she declared that "this extraordinary phenomenon of inter-absorption of the heart muscle tissue with the host, observed under the microscope and also by electron microscopy, proves that no human manipulation of the sample could have taken place."
