Secondly, in keeping with an approach which gives absolute priority to ensuring long-term security of supply — which, as Mr Desama rightly said, is the correct approach — it can legitimately be asked whether it is not better to keep Community coal reserves for future generations, and for the time being to use imported coal, which is clearly less expensive.
We wish also to denounce the attitude of the Council which, without even having the courage to come and give us an explanation in this Chamber, would like to adopt serious measures which, fortunately, have for the time being been made ineffective by the Danish government and parliament, scorning the opinions of the European Parliament and those of the international community.
One point made by Mr Purvis on which one cannot fail to agree with him I can set aside for the time being, and that is the idea that structural adjustment should aim to deal with the real shortcomings in various countries, shortcomings in agriculture, energy, and training, so that our joint action should not be confined to the energy sector alone.
Indeed , the expected substantial lowering of bank fees for crossborder payment services will be sustainable in the long run only if bank costs also decrease substantially . As a result of the Regulation , banks , particularly in countries with highly competitive and efficient national systems with low profit margins , have for the time being the option of either incurring
The Presidency for this six-months' period of office has made its decisions, and it made them together with the Presidents who will follow — those of Luxembourg and Holland — asking the Commission for a timetable for the three six-months' periods, which we have been provided with in part for the time being and of which we are awaiting the complete version.
In the village of Dong Van you can enjoy a beautiful and colorful market on Sundays, for the time being quite indigenous, Although forecast in my magic ball a decline of authenticity and an increase in shops of tourist jewellery in a few years, the pace of construction in the village is frantic, especially around the market. La burbuja inmobiliaria ha llegado Vietnam.
— — — — — — — for the Federal Republic of Germany: the 'Regierungsbezirke' (34); for France: the 22 'régions du programme'; for Italy: the 20 administrative regions; for the Netherlands: the 11 'provinces'; for Belgium: the 9 'provinces'; for the United Kingdom: for the time being at least, the 11 standard regions; for Denmark: the 15 'amter', grouped into 3 regions.
Surely you too are aware, in all modesty, of the hallmark of a fledgling democracy, i.e. that it is more than ample simply to trick the majority into believing that their wishes matter? But as obvious as this may be to you, I have to confess that it seems I still haven't seen the light, so I'll continue pondering for the time being.
They were lobbying for what Mrs Hoff has been asking for: it is essential in this area to create a prosper ous, stable political unit which is attached to Russia for the time being or for ever, but whatever it is we must have geopolitical stability in this region and we shall not get it any other way but by helping this small enclave.
We all know that people in the Member States are cunently very anxious about national security, but because it is to be specifically dealt with at the IGC and there is some talk óf a separate pillar being created for it in future, we thought we should concentrate on external security for the time being. What can we in the House say about this?
First of all, note must be taken of the declaration of sovereignty by three republics; for the time being this would be only at a political level, because we consider that formal recognition at the diplomatic level also would interfere with the negotiations and would upset the difficult balance that, not without difficulty, has led the six republics and the federal Presidency to the conference table.
The ECB stated that, in view not only of the need for optimum efficiencyand timeliness, but also of budgetary constraints, it considered that thesolution it has adopted is a justifiable compromise for the time being. The Bank also pointed out that it was established only one year ago and that itwas confident that first steps in the direction suggested by the complainantwould become visible in due course.
The Commission has adopted a further two proposals, quoted above, which aim to establish the basic foundations for the whole EMU framework: these put forward, on the one hand, the rules needed to ensure initial and lasting stability for the single currency and, on the other, aim to regulate the single currency's relations with the currencies of countries who do not join EMU for the time being.
I don't feel much pressure since I don't have any precise goals, I work in periods: Paris-Nice then the Dauphiné, the French Championships and the Tour de France. I now want to correctly prepare the start of the season: the Tour of course is the race, but I won't be there for a top three ranking so for the time being I focus on the other races.
the competent authorities have determined that an investment firm appears, for the time being, for reasons directly related to the financial circumstances of the investment firm or the financial circumstances of any third party with whom financial instruments have been deposited by the investment firm, to be unable to meet its obligations arising out of investors' claims and has no early prospect of being able to do so,
For the Commission that raised the very pressing ques tion of whether we should continue with the plan and the accompanying social measures, our exchange of information with firms on market trends and prices, before they affect external relations, whether we should keep these accompanying measures in place, given that it had proved impossible for the time being to achieve the central objective of the plan as a whole.
However, I have to say that the information I have been given just now inclines me to believe that, for the time being, unity is making headway and the African Union will be in a position to make useful and effective proposals on how to emerge from this crisis, which is obviously regrettable, and which is a real insult to all those who, in Africa, support democracy and ensure its progress.
Returning to Chomsky's theory-contemplating a competence that is the single speaker's expressive potential and a performance that is the actual linguistic practice of that speaker in a concrete situation-, Mel´čùk contents himself, for the time being, with being able to make a computer work on competence. In other words, the aim is not to have computers translate real sentences, speakers' speech acts, texts that a translator encounters in her everyday practice.
While there are several instruments which have an impact on buildings and construction products such as the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive20, the Energy Efficiency Directive21, the Construction Products Regulation22, the EU Emissions Trading System23, the Industrial Emissions Directive24, the Waste Framework Directive25 and the Landfill Directive26, they focus on different resources and parts of the life-cycle and for the time being they are not designed to provide an overall life-cycle approach.
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (NL) I should like to start by thanking rapporteur Gilles Savary, and all those who have contributed to the end result, for the work they have done, and the rapporteur, in particular, for persevering, despite the fact that the Commission has indicated its intention to abandon the plan of action, at least for the time being, which we have been calling for for so long.
subject to the arrangements agreed under paragraph (9), a vessel employed for the time being in fishing for tuna or tuna-like fishes in the Convention Area outside the waters within its national jurisdiction shall stop when given the appropriate signal in the International Code of Signals by a ship carrying an inspector unless it is actually carrying out fishing operations, in which case it shall stop immediately once it has finished such operations.
In addition, with regard to the requests put by various delegations to the Council bodies with regard to the adjustment of the regulations adopted by the Council, the Commission has, for the time being and bearing in mind the fact that in a number of Member States implementation of the new arrangements is still in its initial stages, not proposed any amendment to the rules adopted by the Council on 31 March 1984.
Bilateral and regional deals are therefore not an alternative to multilateral negotiations, but rather an add-on and a complement that helps to address in greater depth a reduction in tariff and non-tariff barriers, as well as establishing disciplines in areas in which WTO members have decided – at least for the time being – not to negotiate collectively within the multilateral system, be it in relation to competition rules, government procurement or the labour dimension.
However, for the time being, we are keen to address the following message to the Syrian Government: now that it is time to reach a decision on this Association Agreement, please take this message seriously; do not think that, in every instance, we will have to table resolutions in order to finally start a constructive dialogue with Syria on human rights, in particular with the subcommittee on human rights that we are calling on you to set up.
There he remained the entire night, which he spent partly in a state of semi-sleep, out of which his hunger constantly woke him with a start, but partly in a state of worry and murky hopes, which all led to the conclusion that for the time being he would have to keep calm and with patience and the greatest consideration for his family tolerate the troubles which in his present condition he was now forced to cause them.
And while my Father’s spirit shall ever be the divine guide and mentor of all who enter the bonds of this spirit fellowship, to you and your successors I now deliver the keys of the outward kingdom — the authority over things temporal — the social and economic features of this association of men and women as fellows of the kingdom.” And again he charged them, for the time being, that they should tell no man that he was the Son of God.
Given the disparity that exists, might the correct analogy be that the flood engineers are dealing with at this very moment? If the level on one side of the dam is too high, then something must be done to prevent the dam from bursting: If you don't want to eliminate the dam itself, the unequal pressure from both sides forces certain decisions: sluiceways might lower the pressure for the time being; shoring up the infrastructure might keep the water at bay for now.
Who had survived your first assault. ………IG 'It seems they must have dragged their friends out into the hall, with the intention of making their escape in the vehicles which are still parked outside; A Volvo 240GL estate (1983) and a London Taxi, both of which have similar turning circles, although I can't see how they'd all have squeezed in.I reckon they just laid their friends on the other bodies in the hall, for the time being, when disaster struck.' ………PC 'We now have twelve in the heap.
The next step is to adjust the optimisations in such a way that only strokes are found that are realistic options for the individual skater.''Another challenge that still needs addressing is that a measurement system is yet to be developed that can measure the position and orientation (steering angle) constantly and with sufficient precision during a full lap of the track.That is why, for the time being, we are not in the position yet to teach the stroke selected by the computer to skaters using real-time feedback through glasses.'
In view of the present stage of integration of the common market, for the time being certain circumstances will not of themselves justify an investigation of whether an agreement exempted by Regulation (EEC) No 123/85 is incompatible with the conditions of Article 85 (3) of the Treaty. For the time being, the Commission does not propose to carry out investigations into private practices under Article 10, point 3 or 4 of Regulation (EEC) No 123/85 where the following circumstances obtain (this does not exclude intervention by the Commission in particular cases) :
The Treaty of Amsterdam had already transferred these matters to a Community framework by taking them away from the national parliaments, but with two vital derogations from the usual procedures: the Commission must share its power of initiative to propose texts with the Member States during a transitional period fixed at not more than five years after the entry into force of Amsterdam (i.e. until 1 May 2004); the Council will take its decisions not by a qualified majority but unanimously for at least five years, which means that for the time being each country retains its sovereign decision-making power.
So long as the wealthy classes not only do not feel the want of any emancipation, but strenuously oppose the self-emancipation of the working class, so long the social revolution will have to be prepared and fought out by the working class alone.The French bourgeois of 1789, too, declared the emancipation of the bourgeoisie to be the emancipation of the whole human race; but the nobility and clergy would not see it; the proposition – though for the time being, with respect to feudalism, an abstract historical truth – soon became a mere sentimentalism, and disappeared from view altogether in the fire of the revolutionary struggle.
