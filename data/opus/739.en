The Council reiterated its conviction that in order to be effective in the long run the Union’s response to terrorism must also address the underlying factors to terrorism and must strive to contribute to the protection and promotion of democracy, human rights and freedoms and resolution of regional conflicts as well as the economic and social problems in the world.
22 tions in progress or on the waiting list, with input from the Freephone),2and the DAF system that is intended in the long run to describe the legal and organizational framework for a given expenditure or re venue domain, the respective investigation functions of the Member States and the Commission and provisions for out-of-court settlements and administrative and criminal penalties.
In reality, the recommendations reflect current practices which statisticians consider useful, improvements to registers which they consider possible - including some which may involve changes in law in some Member States which in the long run might be acceptable - and future needs so far as they can be foreseen, both of statistical institutes of Member States and of the Community.
The only benefit of organic fertiliser is usually that it is better for the soil and the creatures which live in it. In an extreme scenario, people who only use mineral fertilisers will ruin their garden's soil in the long run because this fertiliser does not provide the humus nutrients and waste required for the soil and creatures which live there.
After 9/11 it is understandable that people in the West fear that international terrorists will strike again. However, making other values, such as human rights and sustainable development, inferior to security considerations may in the long run lead to less security, in stead of more. Moreover, people in Africa, Asia and the Middle East blame the West for applying double standards.
Despite the programme organisers' concern for flexibility, the fact is that none of these programmes has vocational training as a primary aim even if the range of educational approaches to be found within these programmes does offer a few features which should in the long run produce in these countries the competence needed to design their own policies in this context.
In the long run, only politicalization and radicalization of the Czechoslovak working masses, their increasingly direct participation in management of the economy and the State, the appearance of workers’ councils, the institutionalization of workers’ power and of workers’ administration in these councils, can guarantee to the Czechoslovak workers that the conquests of February 1968 will remain alongside of those of February 1948.
The problem with this cynical game is that, in the long run, you begin to believe your own lies, were it only for the fact that the game made you great in the very world to which you did not want to belong: after all, Delvoye did not become the great painter he wanted to be, but nevertheless an icon of contemporary art!
In view of the close proximity to another established and uncongested airport pursuing the same business model with significant spare capacity in the long run, the Commission considers that the ability of the operator of Gdynia airport to attract traffic and passengers will largely depend on the level of airport charges offered to airlines, notably in comparison with those of its closest competitors.
The EESC thinks that if one is to consider the nature of contracts and their classification, one needs to recognise what job they are intended to do: a contract to execute work, once any guarantee period concerning the solidity of the work has been completed, does not, in the long run, transfer any responsibility for management, funding or maintenance to the chosen contractor.
India is fast becoming a superpower, says Shashi Tharoor -- not just through trade and politics, but through "soft" power, its ability to share its culture with the world through food, music, technology, Bollywood. He argues that in the long run it's not the size of the army that matters as much as a country's ability to influence the world's hearts and minds.
3.11.2 Concerning the proposed maximum contribution rate of 40% for specific cooperative projects in the area of Contracts of Association, with priority support for ITER/DEMO initiatives and for initiatives in the context of the Agreement on Staff Mobility, the Committee questions whether, in the long run, this rate may be sufficient for desired projects or actions to initiate the required member states contribution.
Framed in terms of monetary policy in the Netherlands, nonexistent shortterm interest rate differentials is a reflection of the tight relationship between the Dutch and German monetary policies (led by the latter), whereas small, periodically nonexistent longterm interest rate differentials suggest that the DM-peg is credible in the long run.4 Results based on more formal econometric methods (Annex 2) also tend to support this conclusion.
This SIA estimated that, for the EU, the social impacts of this FTA would be negligible, with no impact on wages, and only minor labour displacement6, while for India there would be an increase in wages of skilled and unskilled workers of 1.7% in the short run and 1.6% in the long run, as well as some labour displacement in the direction of better paying jobs7.
It was developed to involve one country, but I believe that we should make it clear that such a European Conference only makes sense in the long run if it is open to all those who from their own point of view or that of the European Union do not yet want to hold accession negotiations but feel that eventually they belong in the European Union.
Even those papers that produce a good image may be damaging to the machine in the long run as dust or fiber particles can build up inside the printer.It's always best to check with the printer specifications to ensure the proper weight and material can be accepted.Most printers will accept papers that are not too heavy or rigid and have a surface smooth enough to allow the toner to adhere.
If this serious problem is not satisfactorily solved, in line with the conclusions of the June 2002 Seville European Council, the November 2002 Return Action Programme, and the November 2002 General Affairs Council Conclusions on intensified co-operation on the management of migration flows with third countries, any new model proposed will most probably prove to be ineffective in the long run, however efficient it may seem in the short term.
Given that type 1 diabetes predominantly affects children and that poor management of diabetes in children can cause problems in the long run, such as kidney failure, blindness and amputations, what measures can the Council put in place to ensure the provision of appropriate education for the patient and his family, as well as providing education campaigns about the disease, in order to prevent the discrimination that many diabetes sufferers come across?
Initially, the Commission considered whether coordination could occur through the following two mechanisms: first, through the coordination of investment in new capacities in order to limit capacity in the marketplace, thus raising the level of average prices in the long run; second, through coordination of output downtimes to support short-run prices during a slowdown in demand (there is no need to coordinate in the short run during a period of high level of demand).
In both cases the a-pawn will be very much alive and I have to say that supported by the bishop from g7 I very much doubt that White will be able to stop it in the long run.] 29...fxe6 30.Rxe6 Rf5 31.Nh4 Rf4 32.R6e4 Rf6 Changing rooks was also possible, but Levon decided that with 4 rooks he can use the fact that white king is cut out and potentially generate some threats against it.
In an extreme scenario, people who only use mineral fertilisers will ruin their garden's soil in the long run because this fertiliser does not provide the humus nutrients and waste required for the soil and creatures which live there. If using organic fertiliser, remember that it takes at least three to four weeks - depending on the weather - for organic fertiliser to dissipate into the soil so that the plants can take up the nutrients.

Should, however, in spite of the imposition of duties, the situation prevailing prior to the imposition of measures (in particular the 53 % market share of imports from the PRC and the relatively small market share of cooperating producers in the Community) remain unchanged, the cost of the possible duty to be borne by consumers and economic operators in the Community (including importers, traders and retailers) might be considered, in the long run, to be greater than the benefit for the Community industry.
I shall be quite open about this: what we will be calling for in the motion for a resolution tomorrow - a temporary general ban on the production and use of animal meal in feedingstuffs until all criteria relating to standards and safe origins have been met, together with the implementation of the Commission proposal to eliminate affected animals for good - is hard for many Member States, but we are going along with it because without society's backing we will have problems in the long run.
It is also worth highlighting the proposal to establish a high-level policy group chaired by the Commission with a mandate to study potential institutional changes within the ongoing economic governance reforms, including the possibility of creating a European Common Treasury (ECT), with the objective of endowing the EU with its own financing resources and reducing its dependence on national transfers, as well as producing a feasibility assessment in order to establish, in the long run, a system under which Member States may participate in the issuance of common European obligations.
Specifically, Marijuana contains more than 480 chemical ingredients, of which are 66 kanabinoidi, among which is the most active THC. Cannabinoids have the ability to bind to cannabinoid receptors, arranged virtually all parts of the human brain, associated with different aspects of the human psyche: experience pleasure, opinion, memory, attention, sensory perception, perception of time ... Consequently,, Stimulation of these receptors, therefore the functions that depend on the neurotransmission which includes, always be accompanied by side effects. For example, analgesic properties of cannabis are manifested through neural mechanisms intertwined with those in the long run lead to altered states of consciousness.
Even the accuracy is not yet at its best: getting this kind of propeller ready for actual use involves a lot of manual finishing after the printing process, such as milling work.But these are obstacle we hope to overcome, so that in the long run 3D printing technology can take its place among other production technologies.' 3D2SKY: 3D printing for the aeronautics industryThe same development curve is underway in a project for Aeronamic companies at the Fraunhofer Project Center.Named 3D2SKY and launched at the end of 2017, this project focuses on achieving higher quality and accuracy in printing complex components for the aeronautics industry.
5. For these reasons, in execution of a mandate received from the Holy Father and echoing the declaration which he himself made in his letter of 30 November 1975 (6), the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith judges it necessary to recall that the Church, in fidelity to the example of the Lord, does not consider herself authorized to admit women to priestly ordination. The Sacred Congregation deems it opportune at the present juncture to explain this position of the Church. It is a position which will perhaps cause pain but whose positive value will become apparent in the long run, since it can be of help in deepening understanding of the respective roles of men and of women.
