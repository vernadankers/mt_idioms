Rumour has it that in the docks of Shanghai, sea captains used to have a most unusual way of recruiting personnel: unsuspecting sailors, with no plans to sail out any time soon, were kindly treated to a drink or two, only to wake up the next morning, with a terrible hangover, on board of a ship already at open sea!
Therefore, given that this issue does not concern just Serbian men, and since the President-in-Office has said that practical measures will be taken, I would like to ask whether among those appearing in the dock — apart from Milosevic, who Mr Habsburg told us about — we will also see Mr Habsburg's friend, Mr Tudjman, as well as Mr Izetbegovic?

I tell you that, if the people of my country had the ability to put someone in the dock, it would be Lord Marshall and his cronies who have continued to push through a policy of nuclear power at the expense of the coalmining sector and the nuclear-free energy-generating sector which could have been produced if that money had been better spent.
Placing the camera in the dock automatically recharges the in-camera battery plus it provides a slot to charge the extra battery at the same time. HP claim that the powerful 1050 mAh battery is good for approximately 200 shots between charges under average use, but careful use of the LCD screen will extend this to about 300 images before a recharge is needed.

But it is also necessary to explain this to these men and women who, for the most part, have watched their incomes shrink over the years, to whom a 39-hour week is a meaningless concept, who have often gone to considerable lengths to adapt and to modernize, and who today feel that they are being put in the dock for having succeeded too well.
Put in the dock in this way, the German Government meekly capitulates, provides billions of Marks and sends soldiers to Turkey and passes on the pressure to those at the grass roots who are protesting against the war: they try to say that Germany's image abroad is suffering from the peace movement, that these people are 'anti-American', and 'anti-Zionist', indeed that they are right-wing extremists.
We are all convinced that guarantee rules for all should be established at the international level, but we are still concerned, all the more so as the decision on this closer consultation between the European Union and the United States was part of an agreement which led to the suspension of the WTO panel when the United States was in the dock over its Helms-Burton Act.
MARTIN, Simone (LDR). — (FR) Madam Presi­dent, honourable Members, the United States, I believe, has always liked to pose as the champion of liberalism, indeed it has never hesitated to put anyone it liked in the dock, not to say the pillory, whom it suspected of not sticking to the rules of the game, of refusing to open up their markets, or of subsidizing their exports.

And during the Nuremburg trails after the war, Julius Streicher, chief editor of the anti-Semitic magazine Der Stürmer, defended himself by saying that even a "genius" like Luther hated the Jews, and he was loved by friend and foe alike. "He would today have been in the dock in my place, if "On the Jews and Their Lies" would have been brought in by the prosecutors", Streicher claimed.
Mr President, today, and over the next few days, dozens of farmers from Karditsa, Trikala, Larissa and Magnisia in Thessalia and from other areas of Greece will stand in the dock accused of having taken part in rural demonstrations held in order to rebuff the all-out attack on them from the common agricultural policy and avoid being wiped out, so that they can stay on their land and in their villages.
The Layers, Channels, Paths, Undo History dock &mdash; note that the dialogs in the dock are tabs. The Layers tab is open : it shows the layer structure of the currently active image, and allows it to be manipulated in a variety of ways. It is possible to do a few very basic things without using the Layers dialog, but even moderately sophisticated GIMP users find it indispensable to have the Layers dialog available at all times.
We have people like Mrs Thatcher who in Europe is presenting herself as the guardian of law and order and the guardian of budgetary discipline and yet, inside the United Kingdom, for exactly the same offence for which we would put the Council of Ministers in the dock, for failing to produce a legal budget by a due date, the same Mrs Thatcher persecuted 47 Liverpool Councillors to the point of bankruptcy and did it in the name of law and order.
