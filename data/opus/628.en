chipped with an identificationchip and twice seen by our vet, they are sold with contract of sales, pedigree, testresults of parents/grandparents, european animal passport and ownerships form and are delivered by ourselves (within reason) together with lots of extra's for kitten and new owner and food for the first few weeks.
