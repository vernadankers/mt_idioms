But there are three key areas where the Commission does not appear to see eye to eye with us, and where the gap between us has not been bridged. We tried as recently as yesterday afternoon to bridge that gap.

I would like the same to apply to genetically engineered products, and I hope that the Commission and Commissioner Bangemann, who has just joined us, will see eye to eye with me on this and follow the proposals contained in this report.
Nonetheless, although Mr Pirker and I may not always see eye to eye - we often argue, and do so with great enjoyment and fervour - he is quite right to say that such debates should not be abused for national purposes.
We do not, as I shall go on to say, agree about everything, but the fact that we agree about so much means that there is always a distorting focus on the minority of issues where we do not see eye to eye.
The experts responsible for this report have noted that the parties see eye to eye on many points and that there is a real chance of reaching a negotiated solution to the crisis, provided that discussions are developed and that the two parties want a successful outcome.

Unfortunately, the Committee on Budgets did not see eye to eye with us on this matter, but 1 hope on reflection that the general rapporteur will reconsider the matter, because things were moving at quite a pace in the Budget Committee the other night, as they always do.
Although we did not see eye to eye in every respect, I do think we managed to agree on the essence, and we will in that way help bring about a European strategy on a subject that is only set to increase in importance in the next few years.
The rest of his speech, like Mr Cochet's, was about a family matter, but it is only very much as a makeshift that I lump them together in this family matter, since I imagine that there cannot be many other family matters on which they see eye to eye!

As I mentioned earlier - and I was also speaking for my colleague Mr Vitorino - we see eye to eye on many of the concerns raised by a number of Members of this House this morning, but this is not an opportune moment to raise the issue of the functioning of the Monitoring Centre itself.

I say to Members of the Liberal Group - we usually see eye to eye, but today, exceptionally, we do not - that we have to set a flat rate of compensation for two reasons: firstly, the prejudice suffered by anyone who is denied boarding is always the same, whether they have paid EUR 150, EUR 500 or more for their ticket.
The need for this more integrated approach to exchange was one of the clear messages to emerge from the Conference on Higher Education Cooperation convened by the Commission last December, and it is a positive sign that in stressing this approach in the context of the ERASMUS programme debate, Member State governments see eye to eye with the higher education institutions themselves.
Although the Council recognises that the European Union and the United States do not see eye to eye concerning the Kyoto Protocol and the ratification thereof, despite this, the Council welcomes the pledge, made by President Bush during a recent meeting with the EU Heads of State and Government leaders, that the United States will not block the Kyoto process, and will cooperate during the forthcoming session of the Conference of the Parties in Bonn in a constructive manner.
And what more could we ask today than for these two men — who of course are different in temperament and could almost be said to be heirs to two different Soviet Union traditions, one more strongly characterized by the Slav character and history, the other by the influence of the West — to be able to see eye to eye for at least as long as it takes the Soviet republics to work out a basis for agreement among themselves ?
If you so fully conform to the Adjuster’s mind that you see eye to eye, then your minds become one, and you receive the reinforcement of the Adjuster’s mind. Subsequently, if your will orders and enforces the execution of the decisions of this new or combined mind, the Adjuster’s prepersonal will attains to personality expression through your decision, and as far as that particular project is concerned, you and the Adjuster are one. Your mind has attained to divinity attunement, and the Adjuster’s will has achieved personality expression.
Let me be very clear - we do not see eye to eye with China on Tibet, and we still have a very real and legitimate concern about the human rights situation in Tibet, as you have both just outlined; about the fact that Tibet has remained largely closed for the international media, for diplomats and for humanitarian organisations for almost a year now; and about the stalemate in talks between the representatives of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities, despite the three rounds of talks last year.
The fact was that the Council in the main took the same or more or less the same view, i.e. that this was the wrong approach with the result that the Council and the Commission, which were in the meantime ready to see eye to eye with each other, came to the conclusion on 7 June of this year that something should finally be done, that they could in fact agree to some extent, but since the European Parliament had not yet been consulted, it should be entered in the minutes that Parliament had not yet been consulted so we should simply issue guidelines.
