I'd rather pay the full whack and not have his ugly mug cluttering up the course.
I can understand it when colleagues from countries which do not build cars advocate that manufacturers should pay the full whack and that they are not interested in the problem of distortions in competition when it comes to setting aside funds.
They're quick enough to ship him out there for Â£10 a head, and then if they don't like it and they want to come home, it's pay the full whack for your ticket or swim!
