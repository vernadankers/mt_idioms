"If 20 000 euros is not a sufficient guarantee, then we have the bank statements right here showing deposits of a total of 50 000 euros and the names of the Dutch people who have contributed to this sum, but if that does not yet inspire enough confidence, tell us under what sort of conditions my client needs to comply to be set free on bail again."
However, in any event, I would like to say that if you see to it that we make progress in this direction, I believe that we can finally put an end to negotiation behind closed doors and move on to the democratic method by means of which all the constitutions of the Member States of the European Union are created, that is to say, openly and publicly, which, at this point in history, means via the Internet and the television.

F. whereas Article 45(7) of the SRM Regulation provides that, upon request, the Chair of the Board is to hold confidential oral discussions behind closed doors with the Chair and the Vice-Chairs of Parliament's competent committee where such discussions are required for the exercise of Parliament's powers under the TFEU; whereas that Article requires that the arrangements for the organisation of those discussions ensure full confidentiality in accordance with the confidentiality obligations imposed on the Board by the SRM Regulation and when the Board is acting as a national resolution authority under the relevant Union law;
