Ladies and gentlemen, in the light of all of this a Par liament such as ours, supposedly elected to build Europe — and this is indeed its function — but con demned instead to tilt at windmills and to endure budgetary and other disciplinary measures whose aim it is to strip it of its power, can have no doubt as to its proper course of action — it must rebel and tell the citizens of Europe clearly the wrong that is being done to them: the ineptitude, the falseness, the political dis honesty of those forces in our national parliaments
I received such a question only this week: is the European Union not mistaking means for objectives, and instead of fighting the effects of global warming, beginning the most expensive tilt at windmills in the history of humanity - a battle with climate change?
In my political life I have not been afraid to take on impossible causes and tilt at windmills and run into brick walls, but I think that if we did attempt some kind of harmonisation of this area, what we would end up with, if anything, would be the most illiberal piece of legislation ever to go through any House anywhere in the world, because it is not possible.
You don't need to tilt at windmills anymore.
