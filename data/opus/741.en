However, the electronic stability control ECU is located close to the firewall in a well protected area and braking systems are designed so that one pair of diagonally opposed front and rear brakes can provide safe braking, so it is likely that the system will be able to help even if there is extensive damage. On very low friction surfaces, the full 6ms-2 braking may not be achieved and the full benefit of Multi Collision Brake may not be realised.Performed assessments Extensive use was made of HiL (hardware in the loop) and SiL (software in the loop) to develop and test the Multi Collision Brake system.

so it's going to be 0,1,2 and the first time into the loop, i, so i'm going to use this convention right over here, the first time through the loop, i is going to refer to the 0 or if we use this convention over here, the first time, as we go through the loop i, could be viewed as a bucket, that is going to be assigned to the first element of the range of 3 the first element of the sequence it is going to be 0 and then we execute what's in the loop we assign, we reassign product to be something new right over here and what is this something new? the first time we go through the for-loop i is 0, 0+1 is 1, so the first time through the loop, this is going to be 1 product is 1, this is the first time we go through the loop, let me do it in the same color so i is 0+1, so we get 1, 1x1 is 1, so product will be assigned to be 1 so product will be reassigned to be 1 which really isn't going to change anything, because it's already 1 so it was 1 before we multiplied it by 1 and reassigned it to be 1 so i could cross out 1, it's not going to be 1 again, but i'll just leave it as 1 or we can just say it's going to be reassigned to be 1, so nothing really has changed that first time through the loop but now interesting things are going to happen so now we'll go back to the beginning of the loop, and now "i" will be the next element in the loop, so now "i", it will be reassigned to be the next element in the loop so now "i" will be 1, that's what the for-loop does, it makes "i" each of the items in the sequence in order, going through them, and now we execute it again now we go look at product times "i" + 1 product is still 1, "i" is now 1, so 1+1 is now going to be 2 so 1 times 2 is going to be our new product so the new product, it was 1, for now we're multiplying it by 2 and assigning it again to product so the new product is now going to be 2 so the product variable is now 2 and then now we try to loop again and now this time, "i" will be the next element
