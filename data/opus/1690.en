When all is said and done, at some point in time there needs to be a rundown of the consequences of total liberalization in all sectors, such as air freight, sea freight, the European ship repair industry, etc..
Still, when all is said and done, the latest findings do seem to sum up the problem with the words: ‘ Fat people don’t know when they are hungry and they don’t know when they are full. ’

I will be supporting the Mavrommatis report, perhaps not as enthusiastically as I support Wigan Warriors rugby league team or St Mirren and Blackburn Rovers, but then again this is only politics when all is said and done.

One of the alternate shots from the session was used as picture of the One Of Us single in Europe and on When All Is Said And Done in the USA. Main difference: Benny and Björn changing position.
Mr President, Commissioner, agriculture will certainly be one of the most sensitive issues at Cancun. When all is said and done, agriculture represents an economic and social market framework the countries of the Southern hemisphere can only dream of.
There is therefore a risk that if the ECB acts without political consultation, when all is said and done it will be held responsible for all ills, which in turn will lead to public condemnation of the entire project.
The drinks container issue can and must be dealt with at Community level, and for that we need a directive, not a recommendation, which would, when all is said and done, simply mean that the subject had been dropped.
When all is said and done, I dare to hope that Resolution 1975 on Côte d'Ivoire, together with Resolution 1973 on Libya, will serve to dissuade others from citing State sovereignty as an excuse for killing their own citizens.
When all is said and done, you'll know your vision is strong and concise when each employee in your facility can clearly articulate the programme's value proposition, and customers describe the training in a way that matches your vision.
The reality of it, when all is said and done, is that we have interests in common, and we share the aim of seeking to render our export refund policy as cost-effective as it is possible to make it.

When all is said and done the engine driving all of the astonishing scientific afford to explore the red planet is the burning desire of human kind to know if life exists elsewhere in the vast reaches of space.

What I will take away with me are the best arguments that I have heard from both sides, which I will try to use to defend a cause which is still, when all is said and done, a common cause.
We are opposed to positive discrimination in general when it is State-imposed, for we feel that merit should take precedence over the quota policy which, when all is said and done, discriminates between individuals who want to fight that very discrimination.
When all is said and done, it has to be acknowledged that many of the problems listed here, such as corruption, fraud and crime, actually stem from Republika Srpska and again and again spill over into the territory of the Federation.
For some time now, these abuses have meant that Parliament has been called upon to initiate measures that should serve to protect the European taxpayer' s money, which, when all is said and done, is what sustains the Union' s budget.
When all is said and done, it has to be acknowledged that many of the problems listed here, such as corruption, fraud and crime, actually stem from Republika Srpska and again and again spill over into the territory of the Federation.
Because, when all is said and done, arresting and imprisoning young people for possessing one gram of heroin while we sit and dine with the prime ministers and ministers of states that are the biggest marketers of drugs is pure hypocrisy.
Television, indeed, is the form in which large masses of our society communicate with each other about their wishes and dreams, and when all is said and done, of course, wishes and dreams are not irrelevant in the world of politics.
Along with calls for wage restraint and top-down control over public expenditure and revenue, which - when all is said and done - could mean a threat to public welfare despite all the assurances that the intention is to preserve it.
All excess is futile and I suppose that if Jean-Pierre Cot wants to play the dictator, then when all is said and done the dishonour caused by his behaviour is to himself, and perhaps also to the dictator, to some extent.
When all is said and done, it is not consumers who will be the losers in this affair but, rather, a certain conception of cultural heritage and of food or wine-growing traditions that are strongly rooted in our regions and territories.
Look at it as a movie if you must and see what roles that people are taking and remember that when all is said and done, when all the costumes and makeup are removed, that we are all beings of light.
I think that within the European Union, we must face up to this situation with clarity, not by replacing reality with a reality of our own invention, because when all is said and done, that produces nothing but discontent and frustration.
I sometimes have the impression that the objective of enlargement is becoming something that we merely preach about and that, when all is said and done, many people will be happy if, in the end, it does not happen at all.
These are fishing techniques which, when all is said and done, are ecologically harmful, uneconomical - within the letter of the law - and which, moreover, in the present situation for some Member States actually cause commercial disputes with third countries.

When all is said and done and to sum up, I personally plead for a restored CAP which, first and foremost, is based on a budget equal to its priorities, with public support that is distributed fairly amongst farmers depending on modulations.
Similar to the group's 1980 track, "The Winner Takes It All", which could have been influenced by the split between band members Björn Ulvaeus and Agnetha Fältskog, "When All Is Said and Done" detailed the divorce between Anni-Frid Lyngstad and Benny Andersson.
There are still a few problems with the proposal, I think, but, when all is said and done, my group will end up supporting the report and, thus, this initiative, because it is so patently necessary that we get it implemented quickly.
I some times have the impression that the objective of enlarge ment is becoming something that we merely preach about and that, when all is said and done, many people will be happy if, in the end, it does not happen at all.
This could be the symbolic counterpart to the work done by the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe, whose next meeting in Vienna in November 1986 comes at a good time from this point of view, when all is said and done.
When all is said and done, you are not thinking of the consumers, whom you have in mind; rather, you are running the business of the big companies, even though you do not really want to. Perhaps you think about this once again.
To change the Council's position or refuse to approve the directive through lack of Community powers would mean taking public health back to national level which, when all is said and done, runs contrary to the meaning and purpose of the Treaty itself.
Of course, with it being a compromise, we are not overly excited about the result but, when all is said and done, it takes account of our group's concerns, which is why we voted for it in committee and shall do so in Plenary.
But I am from the South and when all is said and done I prefer in this affair not to take sides, because the real problem is quite different: it is the problem of European agriculture which is political suicide for all of us.
We are politicians and men of government, whose first aim is to change things when they do not measure up to the true problems — problems which are, when all is said and done, the problems of the people whom we all represent here.
As regards the problem of reducing regional inequali­ties and the need to avoid creating a Community with two different rates of development, the only possible solution, when all is said and done, is to transfer resources from the Community's richer regions to its poorer regions.
The conclusion may be summed up by saying that the Convention is in many respects extremely deficient, but it is, when all is said and done, a necessary means of giving aid to the socalled Third World; aid which is urgent as well as necessary.
When all is said and done, we must not forget that, as you are all well aware, Sudan played host to Osama bin Laden from 1991 to 1996, and it would therefore be very useful to know whether activities are still going on in that quarter.

ABBA's eighth and final album was their very bleakest, but has emerged as a favourite among many of the group's hardcore fans. With Benny and Frida going their separate ways, the pain of splitting up was explored yet again in 'When All Is Said And Done'.
In any case, the problem is not so much within the International Monetary Fund as in other fora which are perhaps more informal but where, when all is said and done, and I note this after three years experi ence here, the real decisions are taken.
When all is said and done, there will be some room for manoeuvre in Parliament’s budget for 2005, and I would therefore call upon Parliament’s leaders to look at the quality of the assistance we are given as MEPs, for example regarding translation and legal assistance.
We can see that the Commission may be tempted to give the shadow of a smile, but we would ask its understanding because, when all is said and done, the final text is the product of consensus between different political forces representing different countries and pressure groups.
We confederalists also have a European ideal and, when all is said and done, it is probably more consistent with Europe's history, more in step with the wishes of the people of Europe and more in line with the policy which our governments are in reality pursuing.
Nor has it answered the question I put, when all is said and done, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection: what is to be done with the nuclear waste that is bound to occur when a power station is dismantled?

You still need to push yourselves so that you may establish even greater mighty virtue within a limited timeframe, and so that you won't have any regrets when all is said and done. So I hope that you will do even better and be even more magnificent.
Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I would like to thank Mr Costa, who did, when all is said and done, put in a huge amount of work, having started by following the activities of the high-level working group on this subject, because it is an own-initiative report.
I agree that there must be cohesion between GATT and the reform of the CAP, but let us not accept what is forced upon us without taking into account the interest of our farmers who, when all is said and done, are citizens of the European Economic Community.
Thus, the unbridled pursuit of material goods and money leaves many wondering, ‘ We seem to enjoy each of the new things we buy; yet, why is it, when all is said and done, that these pleasures do not add up to any greater sense of satisfaction? ’
Whether those steps in the right direction we are now witnessing in Afghanistan can be translated into genuine and sustained improvements of the situation will, when all is said and done, depend upon the Afghan people's own desire to support the process that has been set in motion.

On the subject of the new GATT round, we can be pleased, when all is said and done, with what the Community has accomplished, the enormous contribution it has made in bringing positions closer together and paving the way for the opening of what amounts to preliminary negotiations.
But Austria is also well placed to be a link, a bridge be tween central Europe and countries such as my own, which are not adjoining the CEECs and which, when all is said and done, know very little about them; yet without them enlargement would be a failure.
586 - when all is said and done, is the most reliable means of diluting the concentration of all these undesirable and damaging elements - dust and gas - it being clearly understood that the dust dangerous to human beings comprises only the particles less than 5/x in size.
Bru Puron deserves my applause — and I use the word my in view of the conflict within my group, since I regret that I am unable to support the proposals by my colleague Mr Delorozoy, which, when all is said and done, would introduce meaningless elements into the text.
A few days ago, in a very frank interview in Le Monde, General Lapresle, the French commander of the UN forces in former Yugoslavia, said: 'I must admit that, when all is said and done, peace in Bosnia may depend on the establishment of a balance between the military forces.'
When all is said and done, the question of fulfilling the commitments of both its letter and its spirit which define European Union as an organized economic space where the rigours of financial orthodoxy and the risk of domination by the strongest are attenuated by structural policies and European solidarity.
The Commission has legislated on everything: nets, tonnages, fleet power, number of units and when all is said and done - as the rapporteur tells us - there are fewer fishermen, less cod and even less bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean, hence the fury of fishermen in June and July.
If so, Mr Barrot, if there has been a breach of Community law, please give this House an undertaking that you will refer those infringements to the Court of Justice of the European Communities, because when all is said and done it is always citizens and the environment who pay.
It is important that procedures for use of explosives be adhered to, that prior training and related written information be improved, as well as of course taking all possible steps to prevent accidents because, when all is said and done, these entail a considerably higher cost to society as a whole.
It is necessary, however, to be vigilant and to check that, when all is said and done, this does not mean that ports of call are cut out or are selected exclusively on the basis of shipowners’ interests, and that it does not bring about an artificial decrease in freight rates.
Then a testing fire from God comes to try out that superstructure; and the wood, hay and stubble material goes up in smoke, and when it has all gone the question is: Well, what was the value of that foundation if when all is said and done nothing is on it?
It is for this purpose that there is an appropriation of ECU 135 000 million, an amount that, when all is said and done, is still insufficient in face of the many objectives to be tackled, but it is an appropriation that, in the short term envisaged, enables work to be resumed.
I would also like to stress from the outset that, if we want to boost employment in the European Union, it is of fundamental importance to build on the role of small and medium-sized enterprises for, when all is said and done, they are the hard core of our undertaking in Europe.
In short, it is a proposal supporting the European Judicial Network and what is known as 'good practice' . I would stress this because, when all is said and done, common sense and good practice in applying the various procedures calls, first and foremost, for the direct transmission of requests between judicial authorities.
We are trying to demonstrate that, when all is said and done, it is not realistic to think that in this sphere a few agreements can serve as foundation for authors, performers,etc. to enter into contracts on an equal footing with the major communications media and therefore, collecting societies are an important element
Mr President, Minister, when all is said and done, it is a question of the meaning of words and of our really intending what is stated in Article 4 of the Regulation, namely that access to a document currently being dealt with will only be refused if such access would significantly undermine certain interests.
Without, I think, being carried away by excessive optimism — I do come, when all is said and done, from a country where Aristotle declared for the first time that politics is the art of the attainable — I hope I may be allowed to dis sent from that view, which I consider to be mistaken.
The message is simple – it consists in saying to the people of Turkey: you need not be in any hurry to change regarding this matter; you may continue to make the very mention of the genocide a crime of opinion; and, when all is said and done, you will not be asked to recognise this genocide.
Similarly, the Commission must apply itself to the issue of intellectual property, especially in relation to the Internet, which when all is said and done is the business of the Commission; but because I can see that actually the atmosphere is not conducive to long speeches, I shall just quickly answer the questions that have been posed.
Indeed, the tremendous geographical, human and cultural diversity of the territory of the EU, within what is, when all is said and done, a relatively limited area, represents a unique asset on this planet, but, if we are not careful, it contains the seeds for major imbalances that are unbearable for those who view themselves as the victims.
However, my ultimate goal and the ultimate goal of the Pensioners' Party is genuinely to achieve a single code of civil procedure and a single European penal code because, when all is said and done, if we all agree that a particular deed is a crime, then we must all agree on that without exception and without differences.
The resources which the Community has at its disposal, the principle of solidarity which, when all is said and done, is one of the system's essential attributes, and the system's potential, could all be used to persuade the peoples, parliaments and governments of the Nine, as well as the Community institutions, to make the European Community more 'communautaire'. munautaire'.
In the name of being com petitive with the other exchanges should we be encouraging this casino mentality, which the President of the Commission, Mr Delors, has himself condemned, or should the Community be trying to exert a measure of control over a situation which, when all is said and done, is a scandal for the whole of mankind?
It is our duty to over come this division and to examine current policy con stantly to see how this inhuman division can be dismantled because it is our goal to unite Europe and, when all is said and done, this goal cannot be achieved until a united Europe also includes those countries on the other side of the Iron Curtain.
We are therefore convinced that the Union's Mediterranean policy must take account of the Mediterranean Basin and therefore treat the Mediterranean as a project, mindful of the fact that the rights of peoples take priority over the rights of individuals, if only because, when all is said and done, conflicts between nations harm the life and development of the individual citizens.
This is yet again a matter that the Greek authorities could have dealt with themselves because, when all is said and done, what I observe — and I am not necessarily allying myself with Mr Gollnisch when I say this — is that it is invariably the members of the opposition who express themselves in a manner unpalatable to the authorities in power.
Now, Commissioner, I would just like to unburden myself of the fact that I think it is extremely discourteous towards Parliament that the Commissioner evidently already decided, in advance of this evening' s debate - in which, when all is said and done, people are calling for a regulation on the alcohol limit - that a recommendation to the Member States will suffice.
Indeed, when all is said and done, this deed has been of service since although Mr de Silguy put forward his candidature he has finally withdrawn it, and yet it has enabled us to enter into this debate. However, it does not seem right to me to bring this to a conclusion in only one hour, or by voting tomorrow on a cursory text.
It has already been said that we cannot allow issues which are, when all is said and done, so minor, further to delay an initiative which would carry great political weight, not just because it would put an end to and remedy a situation which has caused great alarm but, in particular, because it would show that, for once, we are being more far-sighted.
In conclusion, Mr President, we in the European Parliament, and the Commission and the Council must encourage dialogue and work together so as to help to bring about peace and prosperity in the region whilst always respecting the wishes of the parties who, when all is said and done, have the greatest interest in establishing a future of friendship and cooperation between both peoples.
We are constantly wasting time in fruitless discussion and, in particular, with all these votes, resolutions, motions, urgent debates and so on and so forth which, when all is said and done, do not produce any tangible results and undermine the genuine legislative activity which should be the principle activity of a Parliament which is not an advisory body but an organ which adopts resolutions.
Everyone, particularly — good luck to him — the Italian Prime Minister, Bettino Craxi, expressed their satisfaction with what was achieved at Tokyo, from the economic and financial standpoint also and not only in regard to terrorism which, when all is said and done, seemed to many to be the most important question, at least as far as the United States of America is concerned.
Such challenges can be explained, among other things, by that basic truth about class societies formulated by Abraham Lincoln, empirically confirmed throughout history, and which is at least one reason for historical optimism (belief in the possibility of human progress) when all is said and done: "You can fool all of the people some of the time and some of the people all of the time.
Such challenges can be explained, among other things, by that basic truth about class societies formulated by Abraham Lincoln, empirically confirmed throughout history, and which is at least one reason for historical optimism (belief in the possibility of human progress) when all is said and done: “You can fool all of the people some of the time and some of the people all of the time.
It has introduced a new source of revenue and rubber-stamped the British rebate, the brunt of which is going to have to be borne by my country, and it is hard for us to accept that France should be making ever-increasing contributions to the Community budget, 50 billion francs in 1988, to fund policies which, when all is said and done, run counter to its interests.
Since, when all is said and done, any telecommunications network is international, if not to say. universal, in character, national regulations and standards must be coordinated and harmonized at international level; two bodies are concerned with these aspects, on an advisory basis and without any legislative power - the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) and the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT).
When all is said and done, it is comforting to note that use of the crystal ball—which we believe to be reasonable —serves not only to justify the extent of the research and development efforts which are being and are due to be made for the promotion of nuclear energy but also to bear out the major trends the importance of which is now generally recognised.
This was the reason for our discussion in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and, when all is said and done, we would not like a repetition of what usually occurs, which is that when it comes to major measures it is always the farmers who pay the price, when they are the only guarantors of a production/agricultural land ratio which Parliament must preserve at all costs.
I therefore call upon all the Members to make representations to their delegations and to their governments to ensure that the situation is avoided where, subsequently, when all is said and done, everything we have planned for in this budget, in this conciliation, is frustrated because of lack of resources, and to ensure that it becomes the joint objective of each one of us, irrespective of our political affiliation.
The amazing thing about the debate on Nice is the image that, when all is said and done, the Treaty has no father or mother but is nobody' s child: the French Presidency has fallen over backwards giving excuses instead of plainly accepting the results of the IGC and the reasons for them; the political groups corresponding to the Member States' governments have done all they can to criticise.
They are intolerable because they are made by a government that has set up military courts and introduced measures described as 'patriotic' but that in fact take away any right to defence, by a government that, since 11 September, has kept nearly a thousand immigrants in prison without lawyers and without charging them, by a government that, when all is said and done, has still not abolished the death penalty.
In our amendments, we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and Community initiatives, so that their application should be reflected, in the best and most profitable way, by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are, when all is said and done, the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing.
We are therefore extremely confused regarding this point, and we call upon the Commission to ensure, when monitoring the ways that the funding is used, that Turkey is not merely pretending to wipe out or combat more minor forms of discrimination without making any effort at all to fight that basic discrimination which, when all is said and done, is at the root of a great many of Europe's misfortunes.
When all is said and done, the success of the agreements, in terms of both trade and cooperation, depends on the extent to which it will be possible to bring about a true complementarity of interests between the Community and its Mediterranean partners, and even among the Mediterranean countries themselves, as, with 1992 looming up, the strengthening of European integration is making a region-to-region dialogue a matter of even greater urgency.
In its implicit affirmation of the individual's right to change sex at will, given that such changes invariably result in sterility, the motion for a resolution disregards the fact that sexuality is not just for personal fulfilment but for the transmission of life as well. When all is said and done, it is subersive, Promethean, to seek to deny a fact of nature and, for the believers among us, a creation.
Secondly, I would like to ask him if Community interests should not prevail in every case and therefore whether we should not avoid any kind of boycott, either direct or indirect, on the effectiveness of this Directive. Indeed, when all is said and done, the Directive serves as an additional feature of the proposed European citizenship since any failure to transpose it would have such serious consequences as to invalidate the elections.
BOGE (PPE). — (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome in principle the Commission statement and particularly its readiness to enter into discussions on the decisions due to be taken with those directly affected as well as here in this House with the Fisheries Subcommittee in the run-up to those decisions, because there is, when all is said and done, a lack of involvement of the European Parliament in the decisiontaking.
Parliament split virtually 50/50 on a strategic matter during the first reading - this for the first time, as I should like to remind you - and a blocking minority, although indeed a minority when all is said and done, imposed its view upon the majority in cutting ECU 1 billion from the structural funds - in the payment appropriations of course - in the programmes for industrial restructuring and the reduction of unemployment.
In conclusion, Madam President, I should like to make one last observation: we expect these require ments to be understood by the new Commission, which should put forward a multiannual strategic programme for our consideration early next year, and they must also be understood by the individual governments, which should, when all is said and done, either have the political courage to relaunch European Union or resign themselves to the unstoppable decline of their respective countries.
Your explanationwas that, by voting the Danish people had expressed a fear which is certainly not justified by the texts signedat Maastricht,but whichis none the less worthy of attention:the fear of losing its identity, of beingdrowned in an undifferentiated and, when all is said and done, oppressive magma.As you warned,in order to be convincing, Europe must at all costssafeguard thevariety of cultures and experiences which have made it so great, too great toharbour petty dreamsof levelling.
But I do believe that the vast majority of the funds used by the Community for the CAP, is spent on ensuring the farmers those prices which the Community has decided must be the minimum prices for their prod ucts; and — when all is said and done — that is what CAP is based on, and not on the proportion of money the farmer gets directly either from the Community or from the buyers or producers who process his prod-
Council of Ministers on development where some Member States ■— I am not talking about France, of course — refused any increase in such aid, I myself in Belgrade witnessed the EEC in the main aligning itself, when all is said and done, with the freeze measures adopted by the United States, and the 77 signatories have spoken bitterly to us about the gulf between what has been said and what has actually been done by the Community during Unctad VI.
MARINHO (S). — (PT) Judging by what we are learning about it, the common fisheries policy is currently not much more, nor will it ever be much more than a mechanism for balancing and allocating existing resources among the fleets of Member States and, when all is said and done, it does not even seek to overcome its inherent vulnerabilities and offer a response to the serious problems which beset fishermen, businessmen and coastal areas which depend on the sea's resources.
That is relevant for anyone living on the continent of Europe who can simply get into a car or hitch hike to take his savings to a Luxembourg bank, but I do not think anyone will feel inclined - unless he has many millions - to take an aeroplane for example from a regions such as the Canary Islands, Guadeloupe or Martinique to place modest savings in a Luxembourg bank. That is when all is said and done a great disincentive.
We hope, on the one hand, that genuine and frank questions will be asked regarding the irregularities and the fraud committed in the implementation of the MED programmes, for which responsibility lies with the Commission. And we hope, on the other hand, that Parliament shows no sign of weakness in exercising the powers of which it is guardian on behalf of Europe's citizens because, when all is said and done, is it not our citizens who have been deceived in this affair?
When all is said and done, I fear that the mistakes made in my country will be repeated, whereby drivers often have the impression that they are being persecuted over trivial matters while the criminals are prospering and that the government measures are designed less to guarantee their safety than to make them pay systematic fines, while the only alternative proposed to the freedom offered by a car is to take public transport, which is impractical, too expensive and often plagued by crime.
There may be a need to coordinate the recording of statistics or to consolidate and update the Eurostat comparison methods - I can see that - but I do not feel that we need to be spending money on further studies and analyses, on information exchange, on pilot projects which, when all is said and done, artificially create jobs subsidised by European, State or local public finances and will continue to do so in the future, but which will serve no practical purpose.
Moderate, well-regulated increases and reduced guar antees are the main prongs today for a new policy, both for internal and international reasons: internal, to restore equilibrium, to which I referred earlier; inter national, bearing in mind that we have progressively to bring internal prices and world prices closer together if we genuinely want to give support to competition with the United States without setting off on a trade war from which, when all is said and done, we should not have very much to gain.
It is to put an end to these and other situations that we frequently see in Europe that the Commission has drafted this timely proposal for a regulation, a type of road map for the right to asylum, which states, for each situation and specific case, who must provide an answer and where, which country must examine an application for asylum and, when all is said and done, what door will open to the anguish of a refugee who wants only to see someone with whom they can speak.
RAFFARIN (LDR). — (FR) Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, since my Group's position has already been defined by Karel De Gucht in another context, I just wish to speak for the regions, thanking the President of the Commission for the prominence he gave in his speech just now to the Committee of the Regions and the deliberations that have started on the need for consultation between the European Community and the regions, because they are natural allies and, when all is said and done.
But, when all is said and done, this summit will have a major benefit - that of outlining, in the wake of Cardiff and Luxembourg, a political desire for greater social cohesion, particularly as regards the 57 million people who are living in a state of poverty within the Union, including single mothers, large families and children, and whose numbers will in the future be swelled by other outcasts from society, specifically those people who will not have access to new areas of knowledge, since this will engender new social imbalances.
The Commission is also gratified by the very solid support shown for many of the constituent parts of our proposals, namely: first, an allocation of Community expenditure that is consistent with the objectives of the Single Act; second, a comprehensive approach to the common agricultural policy; third, a philosophy in which the structural Funds serve as the instruments of essential common policies, on research and the environment inter alia; fourth, the importance of econo mic and monetary cooperation as a means towards establishing a genuine common economic area; fifth and last, the vital but, when all is said and done, modest increase in own resources.
The report I am submitting, with the unanimous backing of the Foreign Affairs Committee, is a significant contribution to this question, proposing, as it does, the inclusion in the new European Union Treaty of a clause implying the inclusion of respect for human rights in a statutory and general way, encouraging use of the most progressive clause, requesting that the Council and Commission take account of Parliament's opinion and that the latter be able to make recommendations on the subject, also asking Council to take account, prior to action, of the criteria of the Council of Europe, the UN, ILO and principal NGOs, and, when all is said and done, asking Council to act in this sphere by qualified majority and not on the basis of unanimity.

Is the Minister aware that even the authors of this report acknowledge that levels are so low as to be insignificant to health; that levels are a thousand times less than other radioactive substances naturally present in teeth; that most of the highest results were recorded over 250 miles from Sellafield; that this material is more likely to be fallout from weapons testing, which has been present throughout the Northern Hemisphere for some years; that respected scientific and academic opinion in Northern Ireland – for which I was the minister responsible for a couple of years – as well as in his own country, contradicts many of the assertions of the Irish anti-Sellafield lobby; and that when all is said and done, this is little more than political scaremongering designed to wreck thousands of the jobs of my constituents in north-west England and to damage the livelihoods of those many communities dependent upon this vital and valuable recycling operation?
