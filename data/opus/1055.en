The Court went on to reaffirm the Member States' right, in pursuance of'Article 36 of the EEC Treaty,' to decide,, subject to the limitations imposed by the Treaty, on the level of protection they wish to afford for the health and life-of persons, in particular the stringency of the checks to be carried out.
And it is also a fact that economic recession, unemployment, social exclusion, the appearance of new diseases, the ageing of the population, as well as advances in research, improved therapies, the development of new techniques of diagnosis and treatment have all had a profound effect on the levels of mandatory social and health cover.
In support of Its action Siegen argued that the absorption of a company's losses by a shareholder did not Increase the assets of that company, and therefore that the national law under which the Finanzamt had requested it to pay capital duty of 1% on the level of those losses was contrary to the directive.
Moreover , the ECB considers that attention should be given to the far-reaching nature of the reform and the residual uncertainty about its influence on the level of capital in the EU financial system as a whole ( even if this uncertainty has been reduced as far as possible by quantitative impact studies ) .
philosophy lite7 click here to go to my homepage español THOMISTIC METAPHYSICS The American philosopher and brain expert Daniel Dennett, wellknown from newspaper and television, apparently considers man as a sort of robot: he thinks that, in principle, artificial intelligence with selfconsciousness on the level of the human mind can be realized in computer systems.
The schist of Herbeumont aims the market of the overmeasure rather, by dissociating standard which offers other advantages but also of other disadvantages, as for all the rocks of the country. In term of market, the career produces mainly for the private one (70%) and is defended well on the level of the public (30%).

The empLoyers, for their part, stressed that the reductions in working time as from 1 December 1986 and the elimination of the waiting period as from 1 January 1987 were already having their effect on the level of labour costs for the coming year and that they therefore had Little Leeway to accommodate the demands.
It further stated that the volumes and prices of the imported product concerned from this country had, among other consequences, a negative impact on the market share held and on the level of prices charged by the Community industry, resulting in substantial adverse effects on the overall performance and the financial situation of the Community industry.
We will support the motion for a resolution in support of this study, but we simply insist that, as this motion for a resolution points out, it is by means of liberalisation and opening up at an international level that we will achieve economic progress, both on the level of states and on a general level.
Consequently, we cannot support proposals such as the co-financing of direct aid for farming, which, though it responds to the demand by some Member States that their net contributions to the Community's budget should be reduced, leads the CAP along the way to renationalisation and in essence calls into question the level of the agricultural guideline.
First, based on the level of boldness of their corporate strategy, as measured by the degree of changes above, and extended to two measures of firm commitment to radical changes, e.g. how they are doing those changes at the expense of cannibalizing their current revenue and profit pools and how they are willing invest in digital technology.
For moat projecta he decides on the level of award subject to the legal maxima and in line with administrative directives specified by his region's Departmental Committee for Regional Affaira This regional committee is however directly reaponsible for large projects (see introduction) while for very large projects responsibility lies with a national inter­departmental committee (again, see intro­duction).

The site collects a fee from the winner of each match in percentage and depends on the level of the players, the sums, and the differences between the levels of the players. In other words, basically the fee is higher the bigger difference in the player's level as an incentive for players to keep to their own league.
Nice to know this is all going to go away … that's for sure!As to you being able to communicate with us … on the level that you do … need we remind you of the 17 or so years that you experienced much discomfort in mind and body in the form of what was termed as 'fits'?

For the purposes of the indicators set out in points (a) and (b), ‘local’ means at national level or at the level of functional airspace blocks depending on the level at which the performance plan is established, including cases of delegation of the responsibility for the provision of air traffic services as a result of collaborative cross-border arrangements.
On 28 December (4), the Commission presented a communication on the adaptation of the ceiling of own resources and of the ceiling for appropriations for commitments to make allowance, in accordance with this decision, for the impact on the level of GNP of the application of the new system of economic accounts (ESA 95) when it enters into force.
Table of contents Info / Regulation / Dossier Recital 106EU GDPR(106) The Commission should monitor the functioning of decisions on the level of protection in a third country, a territory or specified sector within a third country, or an international organisation, and monitor the functioning of decisions adopted on the basis of Article 25(6) or Article 26(4) of Directive 95/46/EC.

As regards the proposed Amendments Nos. 5, 7 and 9, all of which touch upon the level of compensation itself, the Commission is prepared to accept that part of the capital freed by the temporary cessation of milk production may have given rise to interest income, i.e. that the alternative income is in fact rather higher than we had envisaged.
The DS includes eight sections, that identify the holder of the qualification (1) and the qualification itself (2), give information on the level of the qualification (3), the contents and results gained (4), and the function of the qualification (5), allow for further information (6), certify the Supplement (7) and, finally, give information on the national higher education system (8).
We would like to see such a comparison made in the short term because this is the only way in which an informed overall study can be undertaken so that decisions can be taken on the level of aid granted and/or its possible refocusing towards horizontal objectives of common interest, such as research and development, the environment, SMEs, training and employment.
The second subparagraph of Article 12(3)(a) of the sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes - Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment,10 lays down that the Council shall decide on the level of the standard rate to be applied after 31 December 2005.
We believe it would be better to use- the various instruments already in existence and the bodies that administer them, while intensifying their coordination, both on the level of the institutions and at the level of the definition of the policies within which the variations must be inscribed, as was suggested by the Committee on Social Affairs and its rapporteur, Mr Barbagli.
While the information submitted confirms the Commission's findings that the added value of a brand on any given market is company/brand-specific, the information provided is not such as to put into question the level of adjustment that was determined for the branded products sold by the analogue producer on the domestic Brazilian market as the information provided only concerned the Union market.
(2) The new open method of coordination in the field of social inclusion as well as the structural indicators to be produced for the annual synthesis report increase the need for comparable and timely cross-sectional and longitudinal data on income distribution and on the level and composition of poverty and social exclusion for establishing reliable and relevant comparisons between the Member States.
Some say that clients are very satisfied and see no need to facilitate mobility, while others feel that these statistics must be treated with great caution because satisfaction depends on the level of expectation, and it is important to give consumers the opportunity to switch banks without hindrance, enabling even satisfied consumers to switch banks if they find better offers on the market.
The rapporteur did not stop there, however, and by play ing on the emotional aspect of the BSE crisis, has put for ward proposals that are totally excessive and unrealistic. They are excessive in that we cannot simply change the rules on nofault liability without having first carried out an impact study on all the sectors involved and on the level of consumer protection.
(c) introduce appropriate additional precautionary measures based on the level of estimated risk, particularly in relation to production of the listed plant material and the movement of seed potato lots other than those referred to in point (a), produced on the place of production from which the samples referred to in point (a) were taken, in order to prevent any spread of the organism.
This concerns, among other things, the rules on the levels of qualification on which the general system is based, limiting recognition to medical specialisations common to all the Member States, and subsidiary application of the general system to certain residual situations not currently covered either by the “general system” for recognition, nor by the rules on automatic recognition set out in the “sectoral” Directives.
(1) The second subparagraph of Article 12(3)(a) of the sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes — Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment [2], lays down that the Council shall decide on the level of the standard rate to be applied after 31 December 2005.
I also remind the reader that it is expounded in 1171 tht only a small percentage of men get to Level III (= Stages 5 and 6): The majority does not have "self-accepted moral principles" (even if they often like to think they have) but in fact operate on the level of the - much safer, socially much more popular and easier - "conventional role-conformity".
The behaviour of Russian exporters and the influence of the price undertaking on the level of the export price to the Community, the prevailing lower level of prices in third countries and the large spare production capacities available are clear indications that Russian producers would be likely to revert to the Community market in significant quantities at dumped prices in the case where measures are repealed.
ACP goods and services in the national, regional and international markets; the coordinated deployment of all available instruments of cooperation in support of the production, distribution and marketing of ACP goods; the general principle that on the level of individual projects each measure shall be assessed as to its compatibility with its contribution to the improvement of the competitiveness of the economies of the ACP States.

However, it is difficult to establish fixed standards for flicker frequency, because the critical flicker fusion frequency (CFF), ie the frequency at which an intermittent light source just appears steady, or at which a steady source just begins to flicker, depends primarily., like other physiological functions,, on the level of adaptation but also, among other things, on the object's size, contrast and position in the visual field.
Whereas the amounts of import duties depend upon the level of the levy applicable and that levy may be adjusted by monetary compensatory amounts ; whereas, having regard to the trend in the currencies of the individual Member States, the amount of the reduction should be calculated separatelv for each Member State taking account of the monetary comoensatory amount applicable to imports into the Member State concerned ;
In 'Seize obscurs objets de désir', I rather wanted to, conversely, heighten the tension between the organic outer appearance of imaginary entities and the 'seret' underlying geometric construction, as well on the level of the composition of the frame, as on the level of the composition of the plane within that frame. Although the staged entities are imaginary, they look as if they could live in the real world.
The line of action taken by the various Member States in the field of shortterm economic policy, which was generally imbued, at the beginning of 1972, with the desire to limit the impact of the slackening of economic activity on the level of employment, gradually became less geared to expansion, or even restrictive, during the year, in order to cope with the persistent and rapid rise in costs and prices.
The exporters concerned and a group of importers argued that the information on the level of trade determination provided at the time of reopening remained far too general to enable the parties to understand why the comparison of the import price and the Union industry price was done at the same level of trade and it largely left unexplained the factors which emerged from the investigation on which that calculation was based.
With regard to Article 6 paragraph 1, it is clear that there is a fundamental difference between reporting and monitoring the absolute value of the surplus or deficit in public finances, and the level of overall public finance debt as a percentage of the preset basis, for example, gross domestic product, which has a substantially higher information value from the viewpoint of maintaining budgetary prudence than absolute data on the level of deficit.
Each Party within the geographical scope of EMEP shall report, through the Executive Secretary of the Commission, to EMEP, on a periodic basis to be determined by the Steering Body of EMEP and approved by the Parties at a session of the Executive Body, information on the levels of emissions of persistent organic pollutants using, as a minimum, the methodologies and the temporal and spatial resolution specified by the Steering Body of EMEP.
I think I was in good shape before Flanders but a knee problem caused me a lot of trouble in the past few weeks and this also had an important impact on my shape. I just had one full week without any pain, so I hope to have made this step which I needed to make to get back on the level I lost before Flanders. I hope to be able to show something.
The homonymy of the two communes of end, Saint Martin in the Antilles, sits of the organizing firm, and Saint Martin de Ré, close to La Rochelle, place of “Le Grand Pavois” offers an opportunity anecdotic, but carrying on the level the media. The simple consultation of a chart shows that the Azores are exactly on the direct road, thus offering a possible stage as well at the technical level as for a refuelling.
Article 97(1) of Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax1 (hereinafter "the VAT Directive") provides that from 1 January 2006 until 31 December 2010 the standard rate may not be less than 15% and Article 97(2) stipulates that the Council shall decide, in accordance with Article 93 of the Treaty, on the level of the standard rate of value added tax (VAT) to be applied after 31 December 2010.
By 18 April 2017 and every three years thereafter Member States shall submit to the Commission, a monitoring report covering, where applicable, information on the most frequent sources of wrong application or of legal uncertainty, including possible structural or recurring problems in the application of the rules, on the level of SME participation in public procurement and about prevention, detection and adequate reporting of cases of procurement fraud, corruption, conflict of interest and other serious irregularities.
With regard to the Commission’s preliminary assessment that the eligibility for tonnage tax of dredging and towage activities should be based on the operating time of a given tug or dredger in the fiscal year and not on the level of generated income, the Polish authorities argued that the linking to work time to the possibility of taxing a given activity with tonnage tax will not always reflect the use of this activity during the year.
Preparing for population ageing — On the basis of current demographic trends, the EU is expected to witness a substantial increase in the proportion of people in older,non-active age groups after 2010 and a decrease in the size of the labour force.Apart from the potentially important effects on the level of aggregate savings, allthings being equal, a rising dependency ratio will have considerable consequencesfor the contribution of labour to economic growth and for the sustainability ofpublic finances.
Tunisia, which presently presides over the rotating lead ership of the Council of the Arab Maghreb Union, is determined for its part to spare no effort in cooperation with its fraternal Maghreb countries, to advance the process on the level of real achievements and qualitative initiatives now that — during the first fouryear period — the finishing touches have been put to its structures and institutions, programmes have been defined, and a legal framework has been developed.
The same reasoning was applied by the General Court in Joined Cases T-427/04 and T-17/05 France and France Telecom v. Commission EU:T:2009:474, where France Telecom benefitted from a tax exemption and the Commission concluded that the aid was granted annually, i.e. the tax differential due and exempted was calculated on an annual basis and depended, among others, on the level of tax rates voted annually by the local authorities, which conclusion was confirmed by the General Court.
In the case of a system under which the amount of benefit is dependent on the duration of the insurance cover, must Article 5 of the Directive be interpreted as placing the Member States under a duty, as regards old­age benefits payable after 22 December 1984 in the pen­sioner's own right, to remove the adverse effect on the level of benefit caused by a difference in treatment with regard to the accumulation of rights to benefit which is contrary to the Directive?
The publication, dating from 1656, entitled Eclaircissement des véritables quatrains should neither be taken into account since it only covers the events which happened to the last kings of the Valois dynasty, which would be replaced by the Bourbon dynasty. Certainly, these books belong to the history of nostradamian exegesis, but on the level of validation of the corpus they are not important, because of the number of interpolations this corpus had to endure until a certain part of the 17th century.
The communication of 3 September builds on principles of which we approve: enabling the Commission to issue early warnings, placing the emphasis on the level of debt, establishing budget surpluses during times of economic growth to allow room for manoeuvre in times of economic slowdown – the squirrel strategy – being responsive to exceptional circumstances – a concept that the Council of Ministers should incorporate thoroughly – and, finally, coordinating the main objectives of economic policy with the decisions made in national parliaments.
Article 31(5) of Directive 2012/34/EU empowered the Commission to adopt implementing measures setting out the modalities to be followed for the application of the charging for the cost of noise effects including its duration of application and enabling the differentiation of infrastructure charges to take into account, where appropriate, the sensitivity of the area affected, in particular in terms of the size of population affected and the train composition with an impact on the level of noise emissions (‘noise-differentiated track access charges’ or ‘NDTAC’).
56:3.4 (639.4) While mind is more unified on the level of the Master Spirits in association with the Supreme Being and as the cosmic mind in subordination to the Absolute Mind, the spirit ministry to the evolving worlds is more directly unified in the personalities resident on the headquarters of the local universes and in the persons of the presiding Divine Ministers, who are in turn well-nigh perfectly correlated with the Paradise gravity circuit of the Eternal Son, wherein occurs final unification of all time-space spirit manifestations.
I will therefore, when the time is right, propose a policy that will involve, with different degrees of intensity depending on the level of development, all regions in Europe and all countries in Europe, while endeavouring - I am responding here to Mr. Lage - to treat all of these regions even-handedly, in particular so as to avoid, Mr Lage, the mechanical effect that I myself raised in the cohesion report and the statistical effect that could, if applied without due care and attention, penalise regions currently within the EU.
Article 37(9) of the Partnership Agreement between the African, Caribbean and Pacific States and the European Community and its Member States, signed at Cotonou (Benin) on 23 June 2000 and put into early application by Decision No 1/2000 of the ACP-EC Council of Ministers, states that, by the year 2000, the Community will start a process which, by the end of multilateral trade negotiations and at the latest 2005, will allow duty-free access for essentially all products from all LLDCs, building on the level of the existing trade provisions of the fourth ACP-EC Convention.

The joint decision shall take into account the minimum requirement on own funds and eligible liabilities set at consolidated and parent entity level by the group-level resolution authority, and shall follow all steps, other than the ones concerning setting up the minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities at consolidated or parent entity level, of Articles 90 to 93, for drafting, reaching, communicating and monitoring the application of the joint decision on the level of the minimum requirement of own funds and eligible liabilities to be applied to each respective subsidiary at an individual level.
The Partnership Agreement between the African, Caribbean and Pacific States and the European Community and its Member States, signed at Cotonou (Benin) on 23 June 2000 further states that, by the year 2000, the Community will start a process which, by the end of the WTO multilateral trade negotiations and at the latest by 2005, will allow duty-free access for essentially all products from all LLDCs, building on the level of the existing trade provisions of the fourth ACP-EC Convention, and which will simplify and review the rules of origin, including cumulation provisions, that apply to their exports.
95 - Notes that tourists are increasingly using credit cards as a system for payment of tourism services, notably for air travel, hotel accommodation, restaurant charges and purchases of gifts/luxury items; further notes that the charges imposed by credit card companies for their services give rise to adverse comments by many sectors of the tourism industry; calls on the Commission to undertake an examination of the role and functions of credit card payment systems as they apply in the tourism sector, focusing in particular on the level of additional costs which these systems of payment impose on the industry and the consumer;
The Commission has put forward a working document concerning the sci­entific & technological content of the specific programmes implementing the 4th framework programme for Union research and technological develop­ment (1994­1998) and shows the Com­mission's current plans concerning the S & T content of the activities needed to carry out the Union RTD effort. The Commission considers that the introduction of a working document on the specific programmes will help both to advance the discussions on the framework programme and to establish a constructive dialogue on the scientif­ic and technological content of the spe­cific programme between interested partners similar to that already estab­lished on the level of the framework programmes: RESEARCH ON POLLUTION
Whereas detailed rules for the application of the system of import licences for beef and veal products are laid down in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 193/75 < *), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2971/79 (o), and in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 571/78 ( > ), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 485/80 C); whereas, however, it is appropriate to pre­scribe special rules for licences granted under the present Regulation ; Whereas the amount of the import duties depends upon the level of the levy applicable, and that levy may be adjusted by monetary compensatory amounts ; whereas, having regard to the monetary trends in the individual Member States, the amount of the reduc­tion should be calculated separately for each Member State on the basis of the monetary compensatory amount applicable to imports into the Member State concerned :
Recognises that in the course of the discharge procedure a number of bilateral meetings have taken place between the rapporteur and the Commission on horizontal issues of the delegated act specifying further how ‘serious deficiencies’ could be more clearly defined and on how financial corrections could be tightened in case of persisting serious deficiencies; regrets that the proposals of the Committee on Budgetary Control on the level of financial corrections (adding a 50 % and a 75 % rate) were not taken into consideration; deplores that in the latest draft delegated act (of 4 February 2014) the initial automatism for inflicting financial corrections at a higher level, if the same serious deficiency is identified in a subsequent accounting year, has become optional and, as a consequence, the requirement for Member States to put in place supervisory and control systems guaranteeing sound financial management has been weakened;
