Authorizes supply of apples and oranges withdrawn from the market to non-governmental organizations for free distribution to victims of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia.
Most of the extensive underutilisation of ap­propriations can be attributed to lower expen­diture on withdrawals following less produc­tion than expected in 1997/98, particularly of peaches, nectarines, apples and oranges.
The savings with regard to the initial budget can be put down to modest production levels for peaches, nectarines, apples and oranges, which kept withdrawals below the expected levels.

The Regulation enables dessert apples and oranges withdrawn from the market during that marketing year to be made available to charitable organizations approved by the Member States for free distribution to people who are affected by the conflict in former Yugoslavia.
It contends that the act contested in this case did not provide for the replacement of apples and oranges by peaches, but merely amended the coefficients of equivalence between those fruits, that substitution having been authorised by the Decision of 14 June 1996.
As stated above, the contested decision allows the successful tenderers, namely Trento Frutta and Loma, to take as payment for their supplies products other than those specified in the notice of invitation to tender and, in particular, peaches instead of apples and oranges.
Such a substitution is not provided for in the notice of invitation to tender as set out in Regulation No 228/%. It is clear that only the products listed, namely, apples and oranges, could be withdrawn by the successful tenderers as payment for the supplies.
It is thus clear that, on 26 July 1996, the applicant had knowledge of the adoption by the Commission on 22 July 1996 of a decision which extended the possibility of substitution of fruit for apples and oranges laid down by the Decision of 14 June 1996.
It was therefore necessary, in order to complete that operation, to allow the successful tenderers wishing to do so to take as payment, in place of apples and oranges, other products withdrawn from the markets in predetermined quantities reflecting the processing equivalence of the products in question.
The applicant also showed that it knew the content of the Decision of 22 July 1996 by making express reference, in paragraph 23 of the application in Case T-191/96, to 'the fruits in question (apples and oranges, on the one hand, peaches and apricots and nectarines, on the other)'.
On 26 July 1996, at the meeting organised at its request with the staff of Commission Directorate-General VI-Agriculture (DG VI), the applicant presented its objections to the substitution, authorised by the Commission, of other fruit for apples and oranges and obtained a copy of the Decision of 14 June 1996.

Lastly, on 14 December 1993, the Council adopted a Regulation making it possible for table apples and oranges withdrawn from the market to be made available, during the 1993/1994 marketing year, to charitable organizations approved by the Member States with a view to their free distribution to the victims of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia.'
A decision adopted in implementation of a food aid programme, by which the Commission provides that peaches are to be substituted for the apples and oranges initially provided for in the notice of invitation to tender as the means of paying successful tenderers, and which amends the coefficients of equivalence as between those products, established in an earlier decision, must

91 Although the pleading lodged by AIMA in the proceedings before the Italian administrative court mentioned, in an annex, Memorandum No 29903 of 23 July 1996, cited above, the applicant did not receive a copy of that document and did not request one, taking the view that it was a memorandum analogous to the others, relating to the replacement of apples and oranges by peaches and apricots.
Moreover, the Commission does not dispute the fact that its Memorandum No 10663 of 6 March 1996, cited above, contains elements which do not correspond to the conditions laid down in the notice of invitation to tender provided for by Regulation No 228/96, in so far as it provides, inter alia, for the substitution of peaches for apples and oranges as the means of payment for the supplies from Trento Frutta.
Consequently, the contested decision must be regarded as an independent decision, taken following a request from the applicant, on the basis of new information, and it amends the conditions of the invitation to tender in that it provides, with different coefficients of equivalence, for the substitution of peaches for apples and oranges as a means of payment to the successful tenderers in spite of the contacts which took place in the interim between the parties.
According to the second recital in the preamble to that decision, in order to bring about a more balanced substitution of products, over the whole withdrawal period for peaches, between the apples and oranges used for the supply of fruit juice to the people of the Caucasus, on the one hand, and the peaches withdrawn from the market to pay for those supplies, on the other, it was appropriate to amend the coefficients established in the Decision
In the light of the new information brought to its attention in this way and of a reconsideration of the situation as a whole, in particular of the level of the price of peaches on the Community market recorded by its staff in mid-August 1996 (see the D G VI working document, Annex 11 to the defence), the Commission adopted the contested Decision of 6 September 1996, laying down new coefficients of equivalence between peaches, on the one hand, and apples and oranges, on the other.
Furthermore, the contested decision not only provides for the substitution of peaches for apples and oranges, but also fixes coefficients of equivalence by reference to circumstances arising after the award, namely the level of the prices of the fruit concerned on the market in mid-August 1996 although the taking into consideration of such evidence, available after the award, in order to determine the arrangements for payment applicable to the supplies at issue, is not in any way provided for in the notice of invitation to tender.
