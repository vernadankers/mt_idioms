More's the pity the fan's accessibility to interesting places has suffered as well (impossible nowadays, the years preceding 1985 the cars and the drivers were accessible by the public to some extent; pictures elsewhere on this site do account for this statement).
More's the pity if you lost it, then.
We have missed our chance. More's the pity for Europe!
More's the pity or you'd be serving life without probation.
