The Council stated that priority should be given to the control of freshwater pol lution by toxic, persistant and bio-accumable substances, such as those listed in Annex 1 to the Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft, signed at Oslo on 15 February 1972 and Annex 1 of the Convention on the Dumping of Wastes at Sea signed at London on 13 November 1972.
At the meeting of the Working Party on 10th June 1977, with the approval of the Mines Safety and Health Commission, the Working Party took note of the blowout which happenned on the Ekofisk Bravo platform in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, and accordingly formed a Committee of Experts to study measures required to reduce the risk of similar instances at sea in the drilling, producing and work-over stages.
The master of a Community fishing vessel, or his/her representative, wishing to tranship or discharge at sea any quantity retained on board or to land in a port or landing location of a third country shall inform the competent authorities of the flag Member State, at least 24 hours prior to transhipping or discharging at sea or to landing in a third country, of the information referred to in paragraph 1.
I wish to remind the House, for example, that, for the first time in this kind of agreement, we have substantially improved controls at sea and on land by defining the status of Moroccan observers on board Community vessels - I do not think there is any need to stress just what an innovation this is - the presence of observers in ports on a reciprocal basis as well as constant satellite monitoring.
In order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this Regulation, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission relating to the granting of additional days at sea for permanent cessation of fishing activities and for enhanced scientific observer coverage as well as to establish the formats of spreadsheet for the collection and transmission of information concerning transfer of days at sea between fishing vessels flying the flag of a Member State.
The subheading does not cover articles of the winter season which are suitable for a more general use as decorations during that season, because their objective characteristics suggest that they are not exclusively used for Christmas festivities but mainly as decorations during the winter season, such as icicles, snow- crystals, stars, reindeers, robins, snowmen, and other images of the winter season, whether or not the colours or outfits etc. suggest a connection with Christmas.
This particular proposal involves improvements in the identification of ships, the fitting of vessels with transponder systems so that they can be identified automatically and continuously monitored by the coastal authorities, harmonisation and simplification of the data on dangerous or polluting goods by means of a systematic electronic data exchange, a compulsory black box for ships calling at EU ports and stricter monitoring of ships which pose a risk to safety at sea and the environment.
Starting out from the need to improve safety at sea, which is the guiding principle behind my report, I have sought to introduce certain changes which, without altering the legal nature of the Convention, are designed firstly to improve and consolidate the proposal for a directive wherever possible, making it simpler to interpret and apply; and, secondly, to remove any legal uncertainty or conflict as regards Member States' obligations in terms of issuing and recognizing certificates and training seafarers.
An additional number of days at sea on which a vessel may be authorised by its flag Member State to be present within the area when carrying on board any regulated gear may be allocated to a Member State by the Commission on the basis of permanent cessations of fishing activities that have taken place between 1 February 2013 and 31 January 2014 either in accordance with Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 1198/2006 or Regulation (EC) No 744/2008.
If the electronic system for the declaration of fishing data referred to in point 3 of this section is not operational, the EU shall notify Madagascar, before the end of the third month of each quarter, of the data relating to catches and fishing effort (number of days at sea) for each category provided for in this Protocol and corresponding to the months of the previous quarter, in accordance with the template provided in Appendix 5 to this Annex.
The rapporteur, who deserves our thanks for his excellent work, and the Committee have set more far-reaching, important premises, which my group supports, such as including aid for short sea shipping, including combined transport operations at sea ports, granting aid irrespective of whether the company is a public or private company, minimising administrative costs by introducing thresholds below which no checking by or notification to the Commission is required, extending the period of aid and providing the possibility of extending the aid regulation.
Over the years the Council has adopted several recommendations to the Member States on their accession to the 1974 international convention for safeguarding human life at sea and its 1978 protocol, to ILO Convention 147 on minimum standards to be observed on merchant ships, to the 1978 international convention on the training standards for seamen, on issuing certificates and nightwatch duties, to the 1977 international convention of Torremolinos on the safety of fishing vessels and the 1979 international convention on maritime research and safeguards.

Safety and ergonomics at work: — preparation of Directives covering the organization of safety and the selection and use of plant, substances and equipment; — establishment of a system for the rapid exchange of information on specific safety hazards at work ; — revision of the Directive on safety signs at work to bring it up to date; — recommendations on good working practices aimed at avoiding back pain, back injury and falls; — introduction of specific measures for three high-risk sectors: work at sea, agriculture and the construction industry. 2.
CODERCH PLANAS (NI), in writing. — (ES) Despite repeated resolutions by the European Parlia­ment, and especially, the Commission's memorandum on maritime transport, which proposes the creation of a common policy in this sector, the Community, as the rapporteur rightly points out, has still to establish a global framework enabling the foundations to be laid for a Community maritime policy on safety at sea, with standards and provisions that must nevertheless be drafted and implemented at international level and in consultation with the so­called maritime States, par­ticularly the USA, Japan, Canada and the Scandina­vian countries.
If the sport boat season starts now, is financially supported by the German Federal Environmental Foundation (DBU) of approximately 400.000 € Now a research package that was, the protection of vessels against fouling, but also the protection of waters against poison entries specifically for private yachts and motor boats in the eye and has to find alternatives. DBU Generalsekretär Dr.-Ing. E. h. Fritz Brickwedde: “We need to device manufacturers, Cleaning companies and sport boats partners develop concepts, the effective, handy, cost-effective and environmentally friendly methods for cleaning of sports- engine and allow ¬ boot.”

Following several serious accidents at sea, the joint Council of Ministers of the Environment and Trans port at the beginning of 1994 examined problems of safety and prevention of pollution and adopted a programme of action on safety at sea as well as defining guidelines dealing partly with the planning and man agement of maritime and coastal areas. Among the latter were the establishment of compulsory routes for environmental or navigational reasons and the development of new plans, or die modification of existing ones, for the separation of traffic near coastal areas at the request of individual Member States.
Implementation of this Decision does not prejudice the division of competence between the Union and the Member States, and does not affect obligations of Member States under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and its Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and other relevant international instruments.
We had very good weather, only excessively hot, all the way upon our own coast, till we came to the height of Cape St. Augustino; from whence, keeping further off at sea, we lost sight of land, and steered as if we were bound for the isle Fernando de Noronha, holding our course N.E. by N., and leaving those isles on the east. In this course we passed the line in about twelve days’ time, and were, by our last observation, in seven degrees twenty-two minutes northern latitude, when a violent tornado, or hurricane, took us quite out of our knowledge.
