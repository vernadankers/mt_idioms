Make use of our network of eight state of the art data centers all around the world to cope with worst case scenario situations – whether natural or man-made in nature. So if some disaster happens in one region you can have a dupe that’s safe and sound on the other side of the world. It’s a way of ensuring minimal losses (if any) should disaster strike. And, of course, those multiple data centers can also be used for geographical load balancing to optimize resource use and maximize throughput.
The important point on which I wish to lay emphasis is the need for 'technology monitoring', in other words the need to remain on the alert in order to be victorious on the battlefield of know-how, where it is important to keep abreast of the state of the art, to put the Community in a more prominent position on the technology map, both to make up ground where we have fallen behind and to justify programme options in the eyes of the public and secure commitment on the part of management and labour.

IV — State aid control but rather paper sold by any paper producer. e Commission considers that, by analogy with point 29 of the guidelines, such investment aid for recycling may be supported by up to 30 % of the eligible cost only if it complies with the following additional criteria: (i) the investment projects should be innovative and go beyond ‘state of the art’, (ii) the aid should not indirectly relieve the companies that produced the waste from a burden that should be included in their budget under Community law, and (iii) conditions should be imposed to ensure that materials are recycled that otherwise would end up as waste, considering that aid for investments that merely increase competition for the materials to be recycled cannot be authorised.
