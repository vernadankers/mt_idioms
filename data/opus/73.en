You couldn't be more bang to rights if you were wearing a stripy T-shirt and holding a swag bag.
And if they do, that's you bang to rights for perverting the course of justice.
Caught bang to rights you were.
It's what these coppers do when you know you've got 'em bang to rights -- exploit their knowledge of the system to try and tie us in knots.
So we've got you bang to rights and I'm tired of listening to your lies so much so that I'm not even bothering to record them.
