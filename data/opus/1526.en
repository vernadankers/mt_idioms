Not only in this song they maximise the usage of the double voices but also in 'Thanks For Nothing'.
The lightshow and audio are top notch as well and the setlist is simply amazing, consisting of songs from every album Overkill has ever done, resulting in a near perfect "best-off" (save for some personal favourites of course, which in my case are "Thanks For Nothing" and "Bastard Nation").
