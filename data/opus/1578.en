This policy even goes so far as to call into question the Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees, regarding it as outdated, and calls for a complementary system of protection which, to all intents and purposes, will be based on mechanisms such as Schengen and Europol.
It is plain though that the "Turkish Republic of northern Cyprus", to all intents and purposes, has had to become an offshore adjunct of the Turkish economy in order to have any hope of escaping the downward economic spiral in which it has been trapped in recent years.
104:4.44 (1150.11) As they function in this triunity, the Conjoint Actor and the Universal Absolute are alike responsive to Deity and to nondeity presences, as also is the First Source and Center, who in this relationship is to all intents and purposes conceptually indistinguishable from the I AM.

(a) multi-chip integrated circuits (MCPs) means multi-chip integrated circuits consisting of two or more interconnected monolithic integrated circuits combined to all intents and purposes indivisibly, whether or not on one or more insulating substrates, with or without lead frames, but with no other active or passive circuit elements;
This is taking place in a very sensitive part of the world, Mr President, in the Middle East, and although the Community stirs itself from time to time and makes noises about human rights and the right to selfdetermination it is, to all intents and purposes, a passive onlooker.
In Amendment No 13, we look at the question of what I would call copycat advertising where a product which is to all intents and purposes the same - save for a single vowel or consonant - is advocated in an advert as though it were the original product.
After all, could you, Madam President, perhaps explain to me why, according to European guidelines, a black heterosexual man may not be discriminated against when he applies for a loan from a bank or when he rents a house, but a homosexual man, to all intents and purposes, can?
I am sure that, to all intents and purposes, we are all in favour of this, and I would therefore ask Parliament to give this motion the broadest possible approval so that we can show our support for the united approach of our ten countries at the Stockholm Conference.
In any case, we cannot approve of artificially maintaining what is to all intents and purposes an area in which the law does not apply in a country – Cuba – that is a relic of the colonial era and that, moreover, we rightly criticise for its human rights violations.
LLORCA VILAPLANA (PPE). - (ES) Mr President, as the representative of European Political Cooperation has stated, I did indeed submit this question previously and received an answer which was negative to all intents and purposes, in that I was told that European Political Cooperation did not deal with this matter.
Relief from customs duty is provided for multi-chip integrated circuits (MCPs) consisting of two or more interconnected monolithic integrated circuits combined to all intents and purposes indivisibly, whether or not on one or more insulating substrates, with or without lead frames, but with no other active or passive circuit elements.
Mr President, the Council has partially aligned with the position of the European Parliament on the question of the exemption of operators from environmental liability which, in the Commission's initial text, was so broad as to cancel out the implementation of the 'polluter pays' principle to all intents and purposes.
Turkey does not recognise Cyprus, to all intents and purposes a Member State of the European Union; freedom of the press is still curtailed, since Article 301 of the Penal Code has not yet been amended and Turkey persists in not acknowledging the genocide of the Armenian population in 1915.
It is to all intents and purposes, a recital which is not really relevant to the subject of the discussion with the Council, since what we are concerned with here, lex lata — and what a lex — is to implement our Treaties, or to work out how to implement them.
hybrid integrated circuits in which passive elements (resistors, capacitors, inductances, etc.), obtained by thin- or thick-film technology, and active elements (diodes, transistors, monolithic integrated circuits, etc.), obtained by semiconductor technology, are combined to all intents and purposes indivisibly, by interconnections or interconnecting cables, on a single insulating substrate (glass, ceramic, etc.).
Within the euro zone it is not surprising that constraints have been imposed on public spending decisions because if you have, to all intents and purposes, a joint bank account you are affected by the spending decisions of others and you can expect to want some control over those spending decisions.
hybrid integrated circuits in which passive elements (resistors, capacitors, inductances, etc.), obtained by thin- or thick-film technology, and active elements (diodes, transistors, monolithic integrated circuits, etc.), obtained by semiconductor technology, are combined to all intents and purposes indivisibly, by interconnections or interconnecting cables, on a single insulating substrate (glass, ceramic, etc.).
We consider that the amendments by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, with the exception of the amendments by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, are gratuitously critical of the directive in that, to all intents and purposes, they accept the basic anti-refugee approach.
hybrid integrated circuits in which passive elements (resistors, capacitors, inductances, etc.), obtained by thin- or thick-film technology, and active elements (diodes, transistors, monolithic integrated circuits, etc.), obtained by semiconductor technology, are combined to all intents and purposes indivisibly, by interconnections or interconnecting cables, on a single insulating substrate (glass, ceramic, etc.).

The Judgement by the European Court of Justice in case C-106/98 has made it clear that all budget lines must have an appropriate legal base and that in the absence of one, new budgetary commitments must to all intents and purposes be suspended (with the exception of some limited categories of expenditure).
This is why it is carrying out what is, to all intents and purposes, the Anschluss of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, why it is threatening Ukraine, why it is interfering in the anti-missile shield in Poland and the Czech Republic, and why it uses its energy resources in a form of blackmail.
I need hardly remind the House that even though the Mediterranean, being to all intents and purposes a body of water that is entirely sourrounded by land, obviously has special features that are not found in other marine environments, it does not present the very same conservation problems over its entire surface.
Asking the Commission at this time to ensure an unimpeded supply of soya to the EU market by finding a technical solution for the presence of small amounts of GMOs in protein crops intended for use as feed is, to all intents and purposes, handing a major victory to the intensive agriculture lobby.
The Commission and the Council will find themselves faced with a question from me and some of my colleagues, asking how it is possible that mail transfer data from the United States, which to all intents and purposes should be used only for customs purposes, is being passed on to the security authorities.
As the LED chips and the protection diodes are combined to all intents and purposes indivisibly, and the protection diodes are only used for protecting the LED chips against overvoltage, independently of the number of LED chips, the component's characteristics and properties as a light-emitting diode of heading 8541 is therefore not fundamentally altered.
Nevertheless, I must stress most firmly that we cannot be put under this what I might call 'brotherly blackmail' by our friends and brothers in the Commission who make changes and then to all intents and purposes say: 'Now we challenge you to say that this is not substantial and that you do not mind'.
If the Community's main rivals — Japan and South Korea — know that the Community is going to adopt the proposed aid policy, they will merely have to maintain current prices and abstain from major capacity cuts in order to ensure that the Community prices itself out of the shipbuilding markets to all intents and purposes.
This time, these should not be elections without a choice, where the media sings from the same hymn sheet and the opposition has no voice and is ignored, where, after unmonitored vote counting, almost 100% of the voters supported one political party and, in the end, deputies were, to all intents and purposes, appointed, not elected.
Mr President, to understand the debate we are holding on the two magnificent reports presented by Mr Trentin and Mr Marinos, we should remember that Maastricht was not just another European Council; it was to all intents and purposes a Council at which two dogmas were enshrined: the dogma of price stability and that of budgetary balance.
This policy is based on the principle of preventive war, on the adoption, to all intents and purposes, of the new NATO military doctrine for imperialist interventions throughout the world, on the pretext of combating global threats, terrorism and interruptions to the flow of natural resources, the imposition of democracy, crisis management and the principle of preventive strike.
To identify these obstacles and find ways and means of eliminating them the Commission should, together with the nations and regions in this area, prepare a White Paper on development of the Baltic Sea region with a view to facilitating the integration process and making the Baltic Sea to all intents and purposes an inland sea in the Union.
Above all we hope for the future that the Commission will indicate these figures to us sooner since the problem is that when we learn of the true figures at such a late stage, Parliament is to all intents and purposes no longer able to reach genuine decisions on expenditure in November or on the second reading in December.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the fact that we are already able to discuss this issue here today and I should like to start by saying that I consider this, to all intents and purposes, to be the first reading of the Lalumière report, because Mrs Lalumière has invested a great deal of expertise and work in this project.
We say it should be reduced to no more than eight months and, of course, with the amendments which the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has approved, we have, Mr President, to all intents and purposes, agreed with the proposals to sideline codecision, in order to save time and ensure that a compulsory agreement is reached quickly.
Violence and oppression continue, the opposition has, to all intents and purposes, been crushed, civil society and an independent press no longer exist and, of course, there is the issue of the highly adverse impact of the land redistribution policy on food security, especially for the most vulnerable sections of the population and, may I say, for workers on large farm holdings.
This is a major issue, an issue which has attracted the attention of the global peace movement, which has condemned the United States' attempt to put weapons into space in order to serve its aims and ambitions, and if the European Union does not condemn this action on the part of the United States then, to all intents and purposes, it endorses it.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us a very important text, the substance of which will not only determine how the European Union applies research in practice, it will also set the tone for guidelines and practices in all the Member States, especially those like Greece which, to all intents and purposes, have no national research programme of their own.
I should like to draw the Assembly's attention to the fact that today it is to all intents and purposes the owners of the buildings erected in Brussels but cannot actually be the legal owner: our Parliament cannot assert its ownership because the contract does not allow it, since the exercise of the option to purchase is envisaged for future years and not today.
To all intents and purposes this is a humanitarian catastrophe almost without precedent, and for this reason the opportunity offered by the Geneva Conference on 17 April 2007 should not be wasted: the European Union must prepare itself and arrive in force, with a political presence at the highest levels, having already decided on an appropriate amount of funds to put on the table.
In addition to the understandable solidarity that has been shown towards the people who have been affected and the businesses that are, to all intents and purposes, out of action, these people are waiting for compensation to be paid out as soon as possible - in other words, as soon as the committee of inquiry into natural disasters has completed its report and issued its conclusions.
While the entry into force on 1 January 1994 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area between EU Member States and EFTA countries (barring Switzerland) reinforces the free trade area which to all intents and purposes already exists between the two sides, it has not as yet produced the dynamic economic growth expected, especially in the light of the accession of some of these countries to the EU.
I would be most obliged if you could tell me if you condone this approach by the Council, whereby a simplified codecision procedure can only be approved if Parliament does not exercise its right to amend the text presented by the Commission to the Council, in which case we must conclude that, if we exercise that right we are, to all intents and purposes, out of the codecision procedure!
— is not weakened. Were the scenario to which we have been party in a particular sense this year to be further emulated it would result in an erosion of Parliament's hearing rights, leavmg,"»ultimately, nothing but an empty shell, for the negotiations between the Commission and the Council of Ministers would have invariably, to all intents and purposes, culminated in agreement on the very matters which Parliament had been debating.
Thus, it took a fair amount of composure to look down on the new Member States, as Mr Straw did, by comparing the funds allocated to these countries in the forthcoming financial perspective to two Marshall Plans, even though, according to your Foreign Secretary’s own figures, the cheque would, to all intents and purposes, amount to nothing less than a 2000-2013 Marshall Plan exclusively for Great Britain, the fifth global economic power.
However, this much-vaunted interest on the part of the Member States' governments and the Community institutions is pure hypocrisy since, to all intents and purposes, small and medium-sized enterprises are unable to access funding programmes, unable to take advantage of technological invention and technological modernisation programmes, unable to take advantage of staff education and training programmes and unable to do anything about their unfair treatment at the hands of the tax authorities.
In this regard, I should like to draw the attention of the Commission and of the Members of this House to the reality of life in outermost regions such as the Azores and Madeira, where there are no continental shelves and where the coastal equivalent is effectively the coastal banks, which are sometimes a long way from the islands, but which to all intents and purposes represent exactly what the coast close to the land represents for other continental situations.
In fact, it might seem somewhat confusing that we should today be discussing the revision of Regulation No 1408, for, over recent months, during the last few weeks, and in the last meeting of the Committee, we have been having very in-depth discussions about the major and imminent reform, which has been in progress alongside this, in which, too, we have made definite improvements for the benefit of the European public, and which is, to all intents and purposes, about to be completed.
I believe that full freedom of conscience should be allowed in toe vote on the report which is before us, bearing in mind - as far as the socalled statute of the embryo is concerned - that nothing can be done while some claim that embryos are mere clusters of cells, to be produced and used at will, and others recognize them to all intents and purposes as persons, with a statute and rights equal in all respects to those of fully-formed individuals.
Fire Training; Control/Fire Systems, (Fire & Smoke Detection) Ventilation Systems Emergency Evacuation Life Saving Appliances & Survival Systems Rescue Systems Standby Vessels Helicopter Facilities Instrumentation Safety Training 'Good Oilfield Practice' Design & Construction Surveys, Inspection & Control Certification Equipment Reliability Fire Prevention Access/Means of Escape Shut-Down Systems Transport Handling/Loading/Transport Noise & Vibration Toxicity Training 'Implicit Safety' costs are an integral part of operational investment incurred in order to satisfy functional and statutory requirements, which to all intents and purposes are similar and complementary.

Faced with the comfortable and, in many cases, arbitrary pleasure of the image, consumed indiscriminately and without measure, we have legions of citizens who in some cases are, to all intents and purposes, illiterate, and in other cases, real passive résisters to written information and training — a state of affairs which, without wanting to sound alarmist, is jeopardising the freedom of nations, given the clear lack of culture that characterizes large areas, now not just in third countries, but also in our own European Community.
If this fails and there is not a majority in favour of my proposal tomorrow, I will feel obliged, in the interests of achieving a worthwhile outcome, to request referral back to the Legal Affairs Committee, or, if there is absolutely no other way, to reject this version of the report, because I personally neither want nor feel able to take responsibility for something that I am convinced is wrong, and is to all intents and purposes a token gesture that cannot possibly solve the problems we face in this area.
a combination of one or more monolithic, hybrid, or multi-chip integrated circuits with at least one of the following components: silicon-based sensors, actuators, oscillators, resonators or combinations thereof, or components performing the functions of articles classifiable under heading 8532, 8533, 8541, or inductors classifiable under heading 8504, formed to all intents and purposes indivisibly into a single body like an integrated circuit, as a component of a kind used for assembly onto a printed circuit board (PCB) or other carrier, through the connecting of pins, leads, balls, lands, bumps, or pads.
We do not think that any of the individual solutions proposed by the rapporteur, such as allowing Member States leeway to tackle significant exceptional circumstances or permitting a European derogation from the Maastricht and stability pact indicators, or establishing some form of coordination of taxation policies within those frameworks, can work at a time when the very concept of independent economic policy based on response to particular situations as they arise and on the choices of the peoples and governments of the Member States has to all intents and purposes been rendered meaningless.
Multi-component integrated circuits (MCOs) a combination of one or more monolithic, hybrid, or multi-chip integrated circuits with at least one of the following components: silicon-based sensors, actuators, oscillators, resonators or combinations thereof, or components performing the functions of articles classifiable under heading 8532, 8533, 8541, or inductors classifiable under heading 8504, formed to all intents and purposes indivisibly into a single body like an integrated circuit, as a component of a kind used for assembly onto a printed circuit board (PCB) or other carrier, through the connecting of pins, leads, balls, lands, bumps, or pads.

The background is well-known: on the basis of the decision on feta cheese, which was registered as a typical product of European origin as of June 1996, the Commission put forward today's proposal: to set the transitional period during which a product which usurps, evokes or imitates the true origin of a registered product may be authorized - currently five years from the date of publication of the regulation and applicable to all products - at five years from the date of registration of each individual product, in other words, to all intents and purposes, as of now.
Mr President, even though I am somewhat taken aback by the Commission’s indulgence in this kind of denial, and the fact that it is – to all intents and purposes – completely ignoring the blatant warning emanating from the French and Dutch ‘no’ at the European referendums, 2006 will, above all, be the year of the definitive start of the accession negotiations between the Commission and Turkey, which is further proof not only of the Commission’s complete insensitivity to the democratic will of the majority of the Europeans, but also of its willingness to disregard own legal rules, the otherwise so sacred .
Mr President, just as Mr Schulz referred to Rule 34 of the Rules of Procedure, I believe that I, on the basis of that same Rule, am equally entitled, since all MEPs in this institution have the same rights, to say that I regard it as a downright disgrace that, to all intents and purposes, undue advantage is being taken – with your permission no less, since you are not intervening – in that a debate, that is, strictly speaking, not on the agenda, is being held where the largest party in Belgium, or at any rate in Flanders, is insulted and maligned, and associated with a murder incident.
What my fellow member Mr Ályssandrakis said is true; this is the outcome of several events which have encouraged Mr Denktash and the Turkish Government, such as the Helsinki conclusions, which, to all intents and purposes, recognise the invasion and occupation of 38% of Cyprus in that they state that the Cyprus question need not be resolved in order for Cyprus to join the European Union, the declaration by G7, which has abandoned action under the UN resolutions in order to resolve the Cyprus question - and G7 includes Member States of the European Union - and the Verheugen statements, which basically recognise the occupation and the partition of Cyprus in that Mr Verheugen has stated that there is no problem and that the free part of Cyprus will be able to join the European Union.
