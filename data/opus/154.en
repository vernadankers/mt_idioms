I could have the Chinese Mafia or the bloody Customs at me door. The brass neck of the bloody pair of you.
The woman clearly wouldn't know couture from a dog turd, and she stands there, with that pantomime horse of a vicar egging her on, spouting bile and hatred, and she has the brass neck to call herself a Christian?
Twenty grand and I'll nick it straight back for you. You know, just for the sheer brass neck of you,
Can you believe the brass neck on that idiot?
Then someone will come round and take that away from you as well, and then they have the brass neck to come round to your crappy little farm and tell you what they need.
