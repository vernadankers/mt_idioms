Look, just keep your nose to the grindstone.
Just keep your nose to the grindstone... oh, my God!

You keep your nose to the grindstone, but mostly you keep everything in your life separate... work, family, assets.
Now, you keep your nose to the grindstone, and they'll make sure that your next position befits your pretty face.
