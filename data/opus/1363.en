The answer is, just as soon as one has been convicted in his heart of his past sins and sinful life – just as soon as one realizes his own way of life has been WRONG, and becomes sick and tired of it, and turns from his own ways and wants to find GOD’S WAYS and live them, truly REPENTS of his past life of sins, and BELIEVES in and ACCEPTS Jesus Christ as personal Saviour, and the One whom he must obey henceforth, and WANTS TO TURN TO THE CHANGED, DIFFERENT, NEW AND HAPPY LIFE OF FAITH IN CHRIST JESUS, and to become a child of God – then that person should be baptized IMMEDIATELY if possible – and if this is not possible, then AS SOON as a true servant of God is available to perform the baptism.
