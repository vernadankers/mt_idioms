In other words, as discussed in recital 221, where transfer pricing is required to set prices for products and services within various legal entities of one and the same group, the effects of setting a transfer price affects by its very nature more than one group company (a price increase in one company reduces the profit of the other).
After his return to Japan he put together 300 Ju-Jutsu movements based on the principle of Yield to Force, like the branch of the willow that will bend under the pressure of the collected snow so as not to break. Another story attributes the style to a doctor from Nagasaki, Miura Yoshin. This is probably one and the same man.
(continued 2) one and the same State. From the point of view of the sense and grammatical construc­tion of the provision, the only reason for the use of the definite article to denote the State of domicile and the indefinite article to denote the State on whose courts jurisdic­tion was conferred was that one and the same State was intended.'
Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 [20] provides that a goods nomenclature, namely the ‘Combined Nomenclature’, or in abbreviated form ‘CN’, which meets at one and the same time the requirements of the Common Customs Tariff, the external trade statistics of the Community and other Union policies concerning the importation or exportation of goods, is to be established by the Commission.
Given that each of the undertakings achieved in its last financial year more than two-thirds of its aggregate Community-wide turnover within one and the same Member State, this operation does not have a "Community dimension" within the meaning of Article 1, paragraph 2, of Council Regulation (EEC) 4064/89 of 21 December 1989 on the control of concentrations between undertakings (4).
His power is unlimited since it is derived from experienced association with the Paradise Deities; his authority is unquestioned inasmuch as it was acquired through actual experience in the likeness of universe creatures; his sovereignty is supreme since it embodies at one and the same time the sevenfold viewpoint of Paradise Deity with the creature viewpoint of time and space.
Misusing the name of “Jesus” they created division within the Aramean nation on the cultural/ ethnical/ social / national and religious level and incited the nation against one another through which the national unity was destroyed resulting in that one and the same nation is presenting themselves under different ethnical names and with that they fly at one another’s throat.
Though we cannot call them identical, because they are different sides of a process, yet they are different aspects of one and the same process, which is the building-up of consecutive series of perceptions and ideas, pictures and symbols, of the world in which we live, and the means for realising our life in it as a richly varied process.
Since, pursuant to Article 14(1) of the basic Regulation, no product shall be subject to both anti-dumping and countervailing duties for the purpose of dealing with one and the same situation arising from dumping or from export subsidisation, it was considered necessary to determine whether, and to what extent, the subsidy amounts and the dumping margins arise from the same situation.
This becomes manifest in the opposition of the portrait in which the eyes as the mirrors of the soul are seated, and the nude. bird wieland Where body and soul are continuously transformed into one another as two manifestations of one and the same being, the eyes and the face are eventually submerging in the overall erotic appearance of the body.
The minimum amount of cover for personal injury should be calculated so as to compensate fully and fairly all victims who have suffered very serious injuries, whilst taking into account the low frequency of accidents involving several victims and the small number of accidents in which several victims suffer very serious injuries in the course of one and the same event.
MATUTES, Member of the Commission. — (ES) Perhaps it is rather soon to determine what will be the most appropriate means, inasmuch as within one and the same sector different means will be used in different cases, depending on the degree of participation of private initiative — for we cannot rule out the possibility of some investment being financed by private entities.
‘In effect, the calculation of the differential between minimum and maximum discounts by customer … was carried out incorrectly, in most cases, in consideration of the discounts granted by the other party, whereas … that calculation must be made on the basis of the differential between the minimum and maximum discounts granted by one and the same party to its various customers.’
111 At paragraph 205, the Court of First Instance held that the Commission was entitled to characterise that single infringement as 'an agreement and a concerted practice', since the infringement involved at one and the same time factual elements to be characterised as 'agreements' and factual elements to be characterised as 'concerted practices' within the meaning of Article 85(1) of the Treaty.
The Commission has sole jurisdiction to examine transactions where the total worldwide turnover of the companies concerned is greater then €5 billion and the total European turnover achieved individually by at least two of the companies concerned is more than €250 million, unless each of them achieves more than two thirds of its aggregate Community-wide turnover within one and the same Member State.
Multiplication of the bases of jurisdiction in one and the same case is not likely to encourage legal certainty and the effectiveness of legal protection throughout the territory of the Community and therefore it is in accord with the objective of the Convention to avoid a wide and multifarious interpretation of the ex ception to the general rule of jurisdiction contained in Article 2.
Did you know that he is named in one and the same breath with the great French accordionist Richard Galliano ? Both M ario Vermandel as Hans Van Oost showed that they knew how to handle this music and it was great to learn how the three musicians enjoyed playing it - the audience caught on and shared the enthusiasm of the men on stage.
He is nearly contemporary with Togodumnus, a prince of the Catuvellauni tribe mentioned by Dio Cassius, and the similarity of their names has led some, including Dr Miles Russell of Bournemouth University and the distinguished archaeologist professor Barry Cunliffe of Oxford University, to suggest that they may be one and the same, thereby making the Fishbourne king a son of Cunobelinus and brother of Caratacus.
When we consider that the Irish were the "PHOENICIANS" AND ALSO AS WE HAVE BEEN SHOWN, THAT THE "HEBREWS" were the Priestly Cult among the Irish Race, it makes very plain the identity of "These Peoples" as ONE and the SAME. Investigators have noted the relationship between the "Hebrews" and the "Phoenicians", attributing it to the spread of Hebrew culture and influence among the latter.
For the purposes of subheadings 5209 42 and 5211 42, the expression ‘denim’ means fabrics of yarns of different colours, of 3-thread or 4-thread twill, including broken twill, warp faced, the warp yarns of which are of one and the same colour and the weft yarns of which are unbleached, bleached, dyed grey or coloured a lighter shade of the colour of the warp yarns.
As opposed to the a priori method, however the classification system of the different plant cost items has to be modified, for several reasons: a) The distinction between direct and indirect plant costs is no longer meaningful, since the method includes at one and the same time the cost of money during construction, for direct costs as well as for certain items of the indirect costs.
Such overall reciprocal imitation of the members of the endogamous group derives, from an evolutionary point of view, from the imitation of the parents through the child.It originates in the parental axis, extends to the horizontal, sexual axis of the couple, to finally encompass the entire community in one and the same identity.Thus originates the collective, cultural soul of the group, embodied in all of its members.
Whereas Article 16 (2) of Regulauon (EEC) No 1442/93 provides that where the quantities of bananas originating in one and the same ACP State listed in the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 404/93 for which import licences are applied for exceed the indicative quantity fixed for the period Ín question, the Commission is to set a single reduction percentage to all licence applications mentioning that country of origin ;
Second, it should be noted that the Court has held that the need to safeguard the cohesion of a tax system may justify rules that are liable to restrict fundamental freedoms if there is a direct link, in the case of one and the same taxpayer, between the grant of a tax advantage and the offsetting of that advantage by a fiscal levy, both of which relate to the same tax.
It is only today that the ideal of a society where each governs himself according to his own will (which is evidently a result of the social influences borne by each) is affirmed in its economic, political and moral aspects at one and the same time, and that this ideal presents itself based on the necessity of Communism, imposed on our modern societies by the eminently social character of our present production.
I believe we have all benefitted, and that we all start from the assumption that we will not fall back from the standard we have achieved, and that we will together historically force back this historically unique Council, which is executive and legislative at one and the same time - Montesquieu would turn in his grave - and arrive at normal parliamentary work and lawmaking, where we all have our due responsibilities.
It would of course be absurd, Mr President, for us to vote yet again on that annex and the amendments, since we should then risk having two different annexes instead of one and the same annex. I therefore propose — and this will make things easy at the vote — that we consider approved the annex that we adopted yesterday also for the directive that we are now going to deal with.
The former plantation owners then hired "indentured labourers" overseas, especially from Asia, i.e. people who were prepared to exchange a free passage for a commitment to a labour contract tying them for years to work at one and the same plantation, for a fixed wage.How and why such major transformations in labour relations occur in world history is the subject of Jan Lucassen, Outlines of a History of Labour (IISH Research Paper 2013).
As concerns the parallel anti-dumping investigation, pursuant to Article 24(1), second subparagraph of the basic Regulation and Article 14(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community [27] no product shall be subject to both anti-dumping and countervailing duties for the purpose of dealing with the one and the same situation arising from dumping and from export subsidisation.
As concerns the parallel anti-subsidy investigation, pursuant to Article 14(1), of the basic Regulation and Article 24(1) second subparagraph of Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 of 11 June 2009 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community [5] no product shall be subject to both anti-dumping and countervailing duties for the purpose of dealing with the one and the same situation arising from dumping and from export subsidisation.
Whilst normally services are provided and received at one and the same place - the provider visits the recipient or vice versa - or at all events in two specified locations, that of the provider of the service and that of the recipient (for example in insurance by correspondence or telephone advisory services), broadcasting is by definition not bilateral and localized, but of a multilateral nature, covering large surfaces and travelling over wide areas.
Not true, not real, not essential, are considered the distinctions associated with time bound human self-seeking, the arbitrariness and identification of a separated religious, political, ethical or societal ego, which is thus revocable and avoidable as being not essential to the soul. And thus one has absolute, that is to say unavoidable, and relative, that is avoidable, distinctions, alike e.g. the difference one has between dates and weekdays on one and the same calendar.
Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff17 provides that a goods nomenclature, namely the ‘Combined Nomenclature', or in abbreviated form ‘CN', which meets at one and the same time, the requirements of the Common Customs Tariff, the external trade statistics of the Community and other Union policies concerning the importation or exportation of goods is to be established by the Commission.
In line with the principle that no product shall be subject to both anti-dumping and countervailing duties for the purpose of dealing with one and the same situation arising from dumping or from export subsidisation, the level of the anti-dumping duty rates imposed by Regulation (EC) No 1292/2007 was set taking into account the amount of the countervailing duty imposed by the expiry review anti-subsidy Regulation, in accordance with Article 14(1) of the basic anti-dumping Regulation.
Since, pursuant to Article 14(1) of the basic Regulation, no product shall be subject to both anti-dumping and countervailing duties for the purpose of dealing with one and the same situation arising from dumping or from the provision of export subsidies, this duty rate is to be reduced by the applicant’s export subsidy margin as ascertained in the anti-subsidy investigation which led to the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 367/2006 (see recital (59) of Regulation (EC) No 366/2006).
The “amoralism” of Lenin, that is, his rejection of supra-class morals, did not hinder him from remaining faithful to one and the same ideal throughout his whole life; from devoting his whole being to the cause of the oppressed; from displaying the highest conscientiousness in the sphere of ideas and the highest fearlessness in the sphere of action, from maintaining an attitude untainted by the least superiority to an “ordinary” worker, to a defenseless woman, to a child.
This question raises another question: who are we- or better yet- what dies? We’ve given ourselves an identity- which is none other than a product of our conditioning- by seeing ourselves as a real and lasting person. But where is this person? On what do we base this? Examining this in a perceptive way and inviting the mind to enter into another dimension—the Absolute--- we realize that life and death are but phases of one and the same existence.
We are talking solidarity here, we are clearly stating and making it clearly understood that access to new technology and to the information society is not a luxury for the richest regions and you will never stop seeing me act or hearing me voice the demand that the poorest and most remote regions - which are often one and the same - have just as much right as everyone else to join the information society on an equal footing.
Whereas the best solution for attaining these objectives would be to abolish capital duty; whereas, however, the losses of revenue which would result from such a measure are unacceptable for certain Member States; whereas the Member States must therefore be given the opportunity to exempt from or subject to capital duty all or part of the transactions coming within its scope, it being understood that a single rate of tax must be charged within one and the same Member State;
The IB report indicates that, given regular application of manure to one and the same piece of land and uniform distribution of application over the autumn, winter and spring, the effect of 100 kg N in animal manure corresponds to that of approximately 60 kg of chemical fertilizer N, Most arable crops will have a requirement of between 100 and 200 kg/ha chemical fertilizer N, which thus corresponds to a range of 166 to 333 kg N in animal manure.

As regards the argument concerning the need to preserve the coherence of the tax system, the Court of Justice pointed out in its judgment in Case C-35/98 Verkooijen [2000], paragraph 57, that, in Case C-204/90 Bachmann [1992] and Case C-300/90 Commission ν Belgium [1992], a direct link existed, in the case of one and the same taxpayer, between the grant of a tax advantage and the offsetting of that advantage by a fiscal levy, both of which related to the same tax.
WHAT BIBLE COMMENTATORS SAY: After a thorough investigation of the Bible’s 66 books, Louis Gaussen wrote that he was astonished by “the imposing unity of this book, composed during fifteen hundred years by so many authors,... who yet pursued one and the same plan, and advanced constantly, as if they themselves understood it, towards that one great end, the history of the world’s redemption by the Son of God. ” ​ — Theopneusty — ​ The Plenary Inspiration of the Holy Scriptures.
(9) recommends that the Commission put for­ward in good time appropriate proposals to main­tain in the future and develop the appropriate measures; such measures come within the frame­work of the Community plan of action 1980­92 in the field of radioactive waste in order to deal in one and the same context with problems involving the improvement of existing techniques for the disposal of such waste by developing technologies and with questions of a legal, administrative and social nature which need to be resolved.'
the Community and where at least two of the undertakings concerned have their sole or main fields of activities in different Member States or where, although the undertakings in question act mainly in one and the same Member State, at least one of them has substantial operations in at least one other Member State; whereas that is also the case where the concentrations are effected by undertakings which do not have their principal fields of activities in the Community but which have substantial operations there;
It is clear from the documents before the Court that the criteria used in earlier cases to establish whether or not an agent and its principal form a single economic unit are satisfied in the present case because ETA did business on the market only in the name of and for the account of Minoan, it took on no financial risk in connection with that business and, lastly, the two companies were perceived by third parties and on the market as forming one and the same economic entity, namely Minoan.
the originator and the beneficiary may be one and the same person , « cross-border electronic payment transactions » being : -- -- the transfers of funds effected by means of an electronic payment instrument , other than those ordered and executed by institutions , cash withdrawals by means of an electronic payment instrument and the loading ( and unloading ) of an electronic money instrument at cash dispensing machines and automated teller machines at the premises of the issuer or an institution under contract to accept the payment instrument ,
It is clear from an examination of the telexes exchanged between ETA and the applicant and between ETA and the other companies which participated in the infringement, from the applicant's replies to the Commission's requests for information, and from the other circumstances which the Court has considered, that ETA acted in the market vis-à-vis third parties, customers, sub-agents and competitors of the applicant as an organ of the applicant and that the two companies therefore formed one and the same economic unit or undertaking for the purposes of applying Article 85 of the Treaty.
Since, pursuant to Article 14(1) of the basic Regulation and Article 24(1), second subparagraph of Council Regulation (EC) No 597/2009 of 11 June 2009 on protection against subsidised imports from countries not members of the European Community [8] (‘the basic anti-subsidy Regulation’), no product shall be subject to both anti-dumping and countervailing duties for the purpose of dealing with one and the same situation arising from dumping or from export subsidisation, it was considered necessary to determine whether, and to what extent, the subsidy amounts and the dumping margins arise from the same situation.
Coordination of the schemes The coordination is based on the following general principles: (i) an employed person cannot be insured with two different schemes for one and the same occupation. (ii) there is mutual recognition of insurance periods (where necessary they can be aggregated) between all the abovementioned schemes on condition that these periods do not overlap. (iii) the pensions awarded to one and the same person under the various schemes are cumulative unless it is necessary to aggregate the insurance periods, in the context of the various schemes, for the purpose of acquiring the right to a pension.
We should always remain conscious of the fact that hitherto, from the technical point of view, we have un fortunately been able to help only very imperfectly, that, in all modesty, it is therefore a question of increasing happiness (which is to be under stood as being quite individual and therefore generally undefinable) among human beings, of also further ing the joy of living for those who are captives of disease or handicap and thereby of helping to give life a meaning both for those who receive and those who give — which is fundamentally one and the same thing.
The time demanded brief descriptions and the average reader would not appreciate two series of predictions, based upon one and the same source. Therefore, Brotot wrote Nostradamus that for the moment he only wanted one series of predictions (it was up to Nostradamus to decide which one), to which he would add useful things of the other series.[9] In the end, Brotot would publish both of them and would direct the dedicacy to both the governor of the Provence and the prevost of Cavaillon. Further, he would complete tables, meant for "the Bourguignons", with saint days, lunar phases and their meanings, quatrains and French texts.[10]
The questions arising from the main proceedings are whether it is a requirement of the First and Sixth Directives that the method of rounding down per item be permitted and, more particularly, whether the provisions of the first and second paragraphs of Article 2 of the First Directive and of Articles 11A(1)(a) and 22(3)(b), first paragraph, in the version applicable before 1 January 2004, and 22(5) of the Sixth Directive are founded on a method which necessitates the amount of VAT being calculated on each transaction, even if various transactions are referred to on one invoice and/or are included in one and the same VAT return.
But then did not need this fact in no way further explore and develop it even further to deal with, because both the discharge of lightning, so the shapes generated by it they considered all as a work of God. Their access to them could be in both cases very similar and did not need any elaborate or record the fact that one can arise in relation to the other, either because the author was for them in both cases one and the same - god Zeus Thunderer and equivalents, and similar considerations they expected from anyone who will be dealing with their depictions in the future.
(11) Whereas a concentration with a Community dimension exists where the combined aggregate turnover of the undertakings concerned exceeds given levels worldwide and within the Community and where at least two of the undertakings concerned have their sole or main fields of activities in different Member States or where, although the undertakings in question act mainly in one and the same Member State, at least one of them has substantial operations in at least one other Member State; whereas that is also the case where the concentrations are effected by undertakings which do not have their principal fields of activities in the Community but which have substantial operations there;
Whereas a concentration with a Community dimension exists where the combined aggregate turnover of the undertakings concerned exceeds given levels worldwide and within the Community and where at least two of the undertakings concerned have their sole or main fields of activi­ties in different Member States or where, although the undertakings in question act mainly in one and the same Member State, at least one of them has substantial operations in at least one other Member State ; whereas that is also the case where the concentrations are effected by undertakings which do not have their principal fields of activities in the Community but which have substantial operations there ;
But even if we had companies in Europe operating throughout the territory of the Community, even if we could afford the luxury of building several gas pipelines from one and the same point to roughly the same region, even if the national governments were happy to surrender their powers to a European supervisory body staffed by two, three hundred civil servants, even if they were happy to harmonize fully the conditions of competition and tax treatment, there is no proof, from what we know of the US experience, that the difference between gas purchase prices and the selling prices of gas to the consumer would be smaller under one system than under the other.
4191 — Article 12 (1) states the principle that thè regulation can neither confer nor maintain the right to several benefits of the same kind for one and the same period of compulsory insurance, with the exception of benefits awarded by the in­stitutions of two or more Member States in accordance with Articles 41 (aggravation of invalidity), 43 (2) and (3) (conver­sion of invalidity benefits into old­age benefits), 46 (award of benefits), 50 (award of a supplement when the total of bene­fits payable under the legislations of several Member States does not amount to the minimum laid down by the legislation of the State in whose territory the recipient resides), 51 (reva­lorization and recalculation of benefits) or 60 (1) (b) (aggrava­tion of an occupational disease for which the benefit has been awarded).
After breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar, and chased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they went, until they were naked, and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal water of the bar, against the stiff current, which latter tripped their legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun.And now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each other's faces with their palms, gradually approaching each other, with averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays, and finally gripping and struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor, and then they all went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing, sputtering, laughing, and gasping for breath at one and the same time.
For the purposes of this Regulation, a concentration that does not meet the thresholds laid down in paragraph 2 has a Community dimension where: (a)the combined aggregate worldwide turnover of all the undertakings concerned is more than ECU 2 500 million;(b)in each of at least three Member States, the combined aggregate turnover of all the undertakings concerned is more than ECU 100 million;(c)in each of at least three Member States included for the purpose of point (b), the aggregate turnover of each of at least two of the undertakings concerned is more than ECU 25 million; and(d)the aggregate Community-wide turnover of each of at least two of the undertakings concerned is more than ECU 100 million; unless each of the undertakings concerned achieves more than two-thirds of its aggregate Community-wide turnover within one and the same Member State.
(3) Whereas Article 7 (3) (b) of Regulation (EEC) No 1696/71 provides for an obligation in principle on producers who are members of groups and on recognized producer groups which are members of unions to sell all their produce through the group or union; whereas the application of that principle has proved highly problematic for Community producers, a majority of whom are members of one and the same group; whereas the transitional period laid down in the last subparagraph of the abovementioned provision, during which the members of a recognized group may, on condition they are so authorized by the latter, market all or part of their produce themselves in accordance with the rules laid down and under the group's supervision, expires on 31 December 1996; whereas, as a consequence, a decision should be taken on the arrangements to apply from 1 January 1997 and Article 7 (3) (b) should be amended accordingly;
