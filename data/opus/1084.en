The Commission would certainly have something to say about these matters if we had the time, but to put it simply, all the efforts that we are actively making, because it truly is a long-suffering country, will never be effective unless all of the neighbouring countries, or the countries that are involved in some way or another and have some influence in Afghanistan, decide once and for all to stop intervening and interfering.
In view of the large numbers of cormorants in the European Union - which has eliminated once and for all the danger of their disappearance from Community territory - the damage which they cause to the environment of certain fishing communities, and the threat which they pose to the ecological balance of other animal species, there is a need to take appropriate measures to ensure the rational man agement of the cormorant population.
I voted against the Agreement between the European Union and the government of the Faroes on Scientific and Technological Cooperation, not because I am against scientific cooperation between the Union and the Faroe Islands, but because I believe that pressure should start to be put on the Faroe Islands so that the repeated slaughter of pilot whales - almost 1 000 of them are killed each year - stops once and for all.
The Pensioners' Party is against all forms of racism, whoever the perpetrator, it is immaterial whether they come from the right or the left - but I urge both the right and the left to take a step backwards - for somebody has to - and to ensure that real social developments are made in our lives, whoever they are intended to benefit, and that ideologies are, at last, laid aside once and for all.
It is therefore a balance which settles once and for all - and it could not be otherwise if we were to avoid making a mockery of the Treaties and the law - once and for all the question of ecopoints, while recognising that a transitional period is still needed, introducing a time frame which we feel to be preferable to that proposed by the Commission and which we would ask the Commission to evaluate.
There are many other governments, most of which form the most powerful nations and for whom it is in their best economic interests that your world keeps on functioning the way it has until now (because that gives them greater power over the rest of the nations), who are reticent to a first encounter taking place, one that would end once and for all the misleading belief that you are the only intelligent life form in the vast universe.
Oreja Aguirre, Member of the Commission. - (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission first wishes to congratulate the rapporteur of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, Mr Anastassopoulos, on the ex cellent report he is presenting today, and also wishes to express its support for this new attempt by the European Parliament to resolve once and for all the question of the electoral procedure as regards those fundamental aspects where there is a broad consensus among the Member States.
Therefore, considering it positive that military expenditure should be excluded from the scope of development aid, that effective resources should be devoted to developing and improving public services, that the diversion of aid towards objectives that have nothing at all to do with development should be ceased once and for all, these measures will only be effective if at the same time we reject the liberalisation of trade and the instruments of domination and interference set out in the EPAs.
However, if this report is ambitious, it is ambitious at a different level: in its claim to deal fundamentally, once and for all, with the reasons for the delays and hesitations, the recurrent uncertainties and the equivocations which have accompanied the Community education programme, to base it 'on that legal and political foundation which was already evident in the 1976 resolutions, so as to protect it once and for all, from the restrictive challenges and interpretations which have threatened it so far...
This is a tax and not a customs duty, and therefore it is only logical for it to be Collected by the tax administration and not by the customs administration, and we expect that what can be done in the Benelux countries as well as in the United Kingdom can also be done in other Member States of the Euro pean Community once and for all; we also expect the abolition of statistical data collection at the frontier, which constitutes a further obstacle.
Therefore, on the journey towards finding this much longed for peace, ETA' s actions and any other type of violence have no place, are unwanted and neither help nor protect anyone, and the best thing would be for them to disappear once and for all and forever, so that we can move on to a phase of free political debate and free democratic decision making by all Basque citizens without exception so that we can decide on the best political future for our people.
But, whereas these circumstances have been taken very rightly into account in the case of Hamburg when it acceded to the customs union, and are today just as rightly defended, this did not happen in the case of Trieste, perhaps because, up to ten years ago, when the Treaty of Osimo was signed — which, defined once and for all the question of sovereignty over Trieste as well as its boundaries — Italy did not have full national sovereignty but was responsible only for administration.
The evaluation of Community instruments has produced a number of operational conclusions: the advantages of a more sectoral approach and support for reforms - alreadyacted on under Lom6 IV - and of focusing on improvement of the institutionalframework and local capacity to devise economic and socialpolicies integrated into a long-term strategy.This raises thequestion as to whether the EU should gradually abandonthe project approach once and for all and instead try tocreate the right conditions for giving support in the form ofdirect budget aid for the states concerned and sectoral aid.
The rest of the programme is being carried out without major difficulties, and at the same time an attempt is being made to resolve once and for all a problem which is complicated from the technical standpoint, namely, that of converting the emergency programme to provide heating for the orphanages into a medium-term programme; in other words, converting the Com munity's emergency aid into a programme making it possible to restore a primary hospitalization system for children, so as to resolve a human drama that has shocked public opinion throughout Europe.
Barros Moura (PSE), in writing. - (PT) My votes - in dividually and overall - for each of the documents making up this report - leaving aside the detail - are votes for transparency, against hypocrisy, against anti-parliamentary demagoguery and against populism, in order to bury once and for all a process that has lingered throughout almost the entire lifetime of this parliament and placed the European Parliament and its Members on the pillory of tabloid-style reports which are both ignorant and likely to trigger off the public's most primitive instincts.
Once this report has been passed by ourselves, it would be of the greatest satisfaction to all of us who are anxious to save time and patience, if we were all to accept once and for all that no power, no treaty on earth has the right to stop us from discussing what we wish to discuss and that arguments about securityrelated reports, in which the Commission, I suspect, will have a more direct concern than it has in this present one, should be rational in argument and not crudely emotional.
That is not what we are calling for where those res ponsible for the present dramatic situation are con cerned. Undoubtedly, 'Operation Truth', the case for which has been argued very clearly by Mrs Barbarella on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, is designed to meet two requirements: on the one hand, to clean things up once and for all, and put the Community's accounts in order; and on the other hand, to identify the real causes that have created this absurd situation, not so much from any punitive intention but so as to remove the political reasons that have motivated, if not enforced, this behaviour.
