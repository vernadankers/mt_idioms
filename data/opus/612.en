OPINION OF MR MAZÁK — CASE C-132/05 whether the word ‘Parmesan’ is regarded as a generic term in Germany and it is clear that the word ‘Parmesan’ has in Germany always been a generic designation for hard cheeses, grated or intended to be grated.
The former dairy farming authority in Austria regulated certain production areas known as ‘silage-free zones’ up until 1993, in order to preserve the raw material ‘haymilk’ (also known as ‘silage-free milk’ and ‘milk suitable for the production of hard cheese’) for cheese manufacturers reliant on raw milk.
The German Government, supported by the Danish and Austrian Governments, submits that ‘Parmesan’ is not the translation of the PDO ‘Parmigiano Reggiano’ into German but a generic name used to designate a category of hard cheeses, grated and intended to be grated, which includes, amongst others, ‘Parmigiano Reggiano’.
Pecorino is also an Italian cheese, similar in many ways to Parmesan, but made with sheep milk.Manchego is a hard cheese of sheep milk from Spain.I sincerly hope that I don't even have to explainthat you must never use packages of grated cheese in stead of grating your own.
That proximity and the phonetic and visual similarities referred to in paragraph 46 above are such as to bring to the mind of the consumer the cheese protected by the PDO ‘Parmigiano Reggiano’, when he is confronted by a hard cheese, grated or intended to be grated, bearing the name ‘Parmesan’.
In 1975 these ‘Milchregulative’ were streamlined and defined as the prerequisites for milk suitable for the production of hard cheese by the Austrian dairy farming body (see: ‘Bestimmungen über die Übernahme von hartkäsetauglicher Milch’ (rules on milk suitable for producing hard cheese), Österreichische Milchwirtschaft Heft 14, Beilage 6 Nr. 23c, 21.7.1975).
Hard cheese made from cooked paste; it is matured slowly, manufactured throughout the year and used whole or grated; it is produced from raw, partially skimmed milk from cows, milked twice a day, whose basic diet consists of fresh or dried fodder; milk used may come from one milking or from two milkings mixed together.
In the present case, there is phonetic and visual similarity between the names ‘Parmesan’ and ‘Parmigiano Reggiano’, and that in a situation where the products at issue are hard cheeses, grated or intended to be grated, namely, where they have a similar appearance (see, to that effect, Consorzio per la tutela del formaggio Gorgonzola, paragraph 27).
Fourth, the Federal Republic of Germany relies on the fact that in Germany — the only Member State in which the generic quality of the term ‘Parmesan’ is decisive given the present infringement proceedings — the word ‘Parmesan’ has always been understood as the generic name of a hard cheese grated or intended to be grated.
The German Government replied by letter of 13 May 2003 that, although the term ‘Parmesan’ had historical roots in the region of Parma, it had become a generic name for hard cheeses of diverse origins, grated or intended to be grated, distinct from the PDO ‘Parmigiano Reggiano’. For that reason, its use did not infringe Regulation No 2081/92.

(12) In accordance with Article 9 of Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92, the Greek Government has requested that an item be amended in the specification for the name "Kasseri" registered as a protected designation of origin by Regulation (EC) No 1107/96, to increase the maximum moisture content of this cheese from 40 % to 45 %, i.e. the limit applying to similar medium-hard cheeses competing with Kasseri.

Moreover, according to the Commission, the fact that up until the year 2000 a cheese called ‘Parmesan’, which did not comply with the specification for the PDO ‘Parmigiano Reggiano’, was produced on Italian territory does not indicate that the term ‘Parmesan’ is the generic name in Italy for hard cheeses of diverse origin, because the cheese in question was exclusively intended for export to countries where the term ‘Parmesan’ did not enjoy any particular protection, in accordance with the principle of territoriality.

The curd is produced by the separation of the whey, which is then gathered and sent for further processing as appropriate. To obtain further separation of the whey (e.g. in order to obtain a hard or semi-hard cheese), another heat treatment is given to the curd, under stirring at up to 40-53°C. For other kinds of cheese, such as mozzarella or provolone, besides the curd being heated at a higher temperature mechanical processing is also carried out to obtain the characteristic stretching/melting properties (organic acids are used to control the pH and to hold the curd at the right pH for the stretching properties to form).

That’s what you do anyway, right? Every single day. I know it. You know it. We might as well be honest about it, and if some shiny golden bricks wind up serving as anonymous tombstones for your working-class doormats, well, that’s just what they call in Wisconsin “hard cheese.” You’re a Master of the Universe, after all, and this recess(depress)ion hasn’t touched you to any great degree. Sure, you have to shoulder your way through more homeless people these days, and damn if there aren’t a lot more potholes to tax the undercarriage of your Audi R8 GT, but your money is making money at a fantastic rate, and paying taxes is for other people; I mean, come on, your accountant bursts out laughing whenever he hears the words “capital gains tax,” so your egregious sense of entitlement is entirely understandable.
