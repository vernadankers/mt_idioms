The document in which the declarant stated his intention to export the products in question and to claim a refund— as under Article 1 of Regulation No. 1041/67—contains all the particulars needed for the national authorities accepting it to appreciate that the refund was being applied for, subject to exportation taking place: it was of no moment that the exporter did not actually undertake to export without fail.
“ O Jehovah of armies, ” she begs, “if you will without fail look upon the affliction of your slave girl and actually remember me, and you will not forget your slave girl and actually give to your slave girl a male offspring, I will give him to Jehovah all the days of his life, and no razor will come upon his head. ” ​ — 1 Samuel 1: 11.

In the very next chapter after the one that sets forth the Ten Commandments, God’s law said: “In case men should struggle with each other and they really hurt a pregnant woman and her children do come out but no fatal accident occurs, he is to have damages imposed upon him without fail according to what the owner of the woman may lay upon him; and he must give it through the justices.
And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day without fail: That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.
In any event, where a Member State chooses to proceed by that route it cannot, without failing to fulfil its Community obligations, exclude expressly or impliedly one or more of the criteria in Annex III to Directive 85/337, in so far as any of those criteria may, depending on which project in the classes listed in Annex II is concerned, be relevant for the purposes of ascertaining whether an environmental impact procedure must be organised.
And for the protection of both the mother and her unborn child, he stated in his law to ancient Israel: “In case men should struggle with each other and they really hurt a pregnant woman and her children do come out but no fatal accident occurs, he is to have damages imposed upon him without fail according to what the owner of the woman may lay upon him; and he must give it through the justices.
Again Jephthah shows that he is one who ‘ takes notice of Jehovah in all his ways, ’ for he now “made a vow to Jehovah and said: ‘ If you without fail give the sons of Ammon into my hand, it must also occur that the one coming out, who comes out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the sons of Ammon, must also become Jehovah’s, and I must offer that one up as a burnt offering. ’ ” — Judg.
The death penalty was not confined to the false prophet or dreamer because “in case your brother, the son of your mother, or your son or your daughter or your cherished wife or your companion who is like your own soul, should try to allure you in secrecy, saying, ‘ Let us go and serve other gods, ’... you must not accede to his wish or listen to him, nor should your eye feel sorry for him, nor must you feel compassion, nor cover him protectively, but you should kill him without fail.
Under Jehovah’s spirit Jephthah proceeded to the battle, but prior to engaging the enemy he made his famous vow, the vow of a man wholly interested in victory for the honor of Jehovah’s name: “If you without fail give the sons of Ammon into my hand, then it must occur that the one coming out, who comes out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the sons of Ammon, must then become Jehovah’s and I must offer that one up as a burnt offering. ” — Judg.
Now, I feel that we must make human rights our priority, and I would therefore like to take this opportunity to ask the President of Parliament to send a letter to the Colombian authorities calling for respect for human rights and urging the government to make every endeavour to ensure, since it says that it is negotiating with the Liberation Army and the other forces, that any agreement reached will, without fail, include the immediate liberation of all the European and Colombian citizens - both Europeans and non-Europeans - who are deprived of their freedom and are prisoners of the militaries.
What Jesus Christ said on this matter was similar to the principles set out in the Mosaic law. Of family members or friends who refused to give Jehovah God exclusive devotion and tried to influence others to be unfaithful to him, the Law said: “In case your brother, the son of your mother, or your son or your daughter or your cherished wife or your companion who is like your own soul, should try to allure you in secrecy, saying, ‘ Let us go and serve other gods, ’... you must not accede to his wish or listen to him, nor should your eye feel sorry for him, nor must you feel compassion, nor cover him protectively; but you should kill him without fail.
