Since the United Kingdom pays about a thousand million pounds a year, after allowing for all the money flowing back, all the grants and all the other nonsense, and since we have a balance of trade deficit in manufactured goods of ten thousand million pounds, could he tell us what benefits are derived from membership of the common market, especially in the light of all those promises about jobs for the boys and the other illusions spread about in 1973 and 1975?
Introduced to the UK, Â£20, 000 million would be made available to SMEs to invest and grow businesses and jobs - jobs for the boys and girls, who are perennially ignored by Britain's bankrupt government.
Will they try to explain how it is that the Common Market, after all those wonderful promises of jobs for the boys in the 1970s, still has 15 million people unemployed, a number that is continually increasing?
It is not about jobs for the boys and girls, but about appointing the right people for all of those very important positions that have been created.
