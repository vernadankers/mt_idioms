I was determined not to let Satan have the last laugh in my case. ‚Äù
Act the fool, play the calf And you'll always have the last laugh
Shut up. I'll have the last laugh when I'm a horribly underpaid teaching assistant.
I'll have the last laugh when he finds out I wrapped his cab around a telephone pole, wearing his favorite shirt.
Fine, but we'll have the last laugh tonight, art whore.
But we'll have the last laugh on thoseJohnny-come-not-lies.
We'll see who's going to have the last laugh around here.
Baby, you will have the last laugh when you're a doctor... and they're stuck living off of ramen noodles and unemployment cheques.
But I will yet have the last laugh on Adama, mark my words.
