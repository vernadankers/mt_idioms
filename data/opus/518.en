I will do my best in my group — as I am sure everyone will do in their groups — to make sure that the principles that guided Dr Aigner will continue to be pursued and will come to fruition as we get to grips with some of the problems that he grappled with and was on the way to solving.
Although in theory legal protection of the individual is already assured under existing practice, it is difficult for a person who has been involved in a traffic accident in another country, when there is a court case for example, to get to grips with a foreign culture and with foreign legislation and legal practice, often resulting in very long process delays.
We all have to consider necessary reforms, and I believe it is essential that all institutions try to put forward a medium-term plan so that we can see where changes are necessary in order to get to grips with Category V. We really need to give thought to whether a high level group or similar should be deployed to deal with these issues.
Mrs Hoff and the Members of Par liament in general will be able to see, gradually as the work progresses, that we have not spent nine months doing nothing, but that we have put forward some extremely consistent proposals which moreover get to grips with a large number of the problems to which Mrs Hoff and the other rapporteurs have quite rightly drawn attention.
So we said that, in order to have a large majority in this House and to remain committed to the topic, we favour removing it for this week, but finding in the immediate future an appropriate procedure in order that we may get to grips with this topic in a way it very much deserves, with the Council and the Commission present if necessary.
It is always someone else, and I would like it if, for once, in this Commission, in this debate, we heard no more of the meaningless comments that Mr Schulz, Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Daul come out with: 'the best thing would be to reject this Commission so that, together, we can finally get to grips with what is really happening in the world'.
Two things are necessary: one is that the Member States should maintain their restrictions on arms sales, and the other is that we should get to grips with the actual facts about the People’s Republic of China – at national level, at Community level and, it is to be hoped, eventually in early 2004, at the international level at the Human Rights Convention in Geneva.

One of the jobs that has come to me, as Chair of the Committee on Agriculture, and which we are particularly trying to get to grips with, is that, on the occasion of the Council of Ministers held in Brussels on 16 July 2007, the Commission reiterated its full support for the nomination of the Mediterranean diet as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO.
We should however say that it is incumbent on this House to get to grips with exactly what happened with the administrative muddle. I can tell you that there were British senior citizens who pulled out at the last minute, literally within 24 hours of the Parliament taking place, because they had not received tickets, did not know what hotels they were in, etc., etc.
We ought not to be surprised that European workers can no longer get to grips with a Europe in which some people earn a fortune without working, when one sees the volume of work that that requires, and the others have to resign themselves to accepting this, to being subjected to the appeals that we launch to them to encourage them to support wage moderation.
I should like to conclude by saying that I hope that the good will and mutual recognition which have been expressed in this Chamber, from the extreme left to the extreme right, will mean that we get to grips with pollution as a whole and at the same time safeguard our food production, with due regard to the many who are starving around the world.
You need to explain to me how you can truly get to grips with this fragmentation of policy in the area of consumer protection, but also in other areas like foreign policy, so that we have a policy that, after five years, will allow us to say 'yes, it was worth having a Commission like this'. I do not yet know how I will vote later.
Mr President, this report is highly significant, because ever since the beginning of the second stage of monetary union the European Parliament has been calling for an interinstitutional agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, so that in the excessive deficit procedures, and more particularly in the basic aspects of economic policy and its enforcement, we can get to grips with the problem of democratic deficit.
In summary, FP5 will make its contribution by helping: • Companies and universities get to grips with the knowledge and expertise - increasingly technological in nature - necessary to face up to the challenges presented by the new millennium and increasing globalization; • European society use technical progress to find innovative solutions to the major problems which confront it, such as employment, health, environment, energy supply, transport and mobility, education and training;
Catwoman is an extremely different kind of character to Batman, so you'll need to take a little time to get to grips with her whip, speed and vicious claw attacks.With a huge number of side missions to explore, you'll soon find yourself rescuing political prisoners from thugs in the street, hunting down the hundreds of Riddler challenges and answering payphones to take on smaller, but equally rewarding missions involving the psychotic Victor Zsasz.
Although our counterparts have done important work, and despite my gratitude to them for doing so and thus enabling themselves to really get to grips with these issues, I have to say that I am less happy about our entering into another obligation, as anyone reading the text of this interinstitutional agreement could only wonder what added value would thereby accrue to Parliament over and above its rights as laid down in the Treaties.
Mr President, I hope that in the coming months we will be able to have a real debate on the relationship between private enterprise and development, between opening up markets and development aid, and I would be delighted if an own-initiative report were to come from Parliament itself, so that we could try to study in depth a problem with is very difficult to get to grips with and over which opposing economic doctrines clash.
Most of those pretexts are something to do with the fact that governments - and I am prepared to say so quite provocatively -are no longer able to get to grips with their problems of internal policy, whether economic or social, so that they arrange their border controls as a theatrical production in order to calm their own populations, saying in effect, 'Everything's under control on the crime front provided we have enough policemen at the borders.'
PAPOUTSIS (S). — (GR) Mr President, the report we are debating does, I believe, get to grips with many of the more important problems of small and mediumsized undertakings and craft industries in the Community. The sections on taxation, funding and industrial cooperation offer positive proposals which, if implemented, will do a great deal to help small and mediumsized undertakings and craft industries, especially in countries like Greece where they are the backbone of the national economy.

In the face of this budget of hesitation, or even confusion, Parliament must rapidly get down to considera tion of these major proposals put forward in recent months and years, and, acting in concert with the Member States and the Council, convert them into reality, so enabling the 1984 and subsequent budgets to perform the multiplying role whereby all the Member States can get to grips with the situation and find solutions to the Community's economic and social ills.
About 18 months ago the Commission organized an internal seminar attended by experts of world renown from all over the world to see what stage we have reached by comparing all the methods being used to get to grips with this subject, and everyone agreed that, particularly where the absorptive capacity of the oceans is concerned, we must step up our action very considerably and that we will probably be unable to come to a reliable conclusion without using satellites.
Yes, we need to understand each other, as the Council President has said, but surely we need more collaboration, not just in particular instances, such as the war against terrorism: we need a long-term framework to get to grips with that problem and shift the emphasis from a Community of values to a Community of action, dealing with problems of AIDS in the Third World, nuclear proliferation and a range of other things which Europe and America face jointly as global challenges.
As a rapporteur from a Member State that joined the European Union during the recent enlargement, I had the opportunity to get to grips with the complexity of the legislative process. That is why I would particularly like to thank, for their extremely constructive and positive cooperation, Commissioner Danuta Hübner, the representatives of DG REGIO, the representatives of the successive presidencies, especially the Austrian Presidency, the secretariat of the Committee on Regional Development, the political advisors and also my collaborators and experts from Poland.
Now, whatever the real faults of the British Government may be, they cannot explain or excuse toe inertia of toe Commission in confronting toe dangers, its abandonment of the principle of caution, its failure to get to grips with the public health aspect, an attitude which it carried to extreme lengths when, as late as June 1996, it managed to push through toe conditional lifting of the embargo on gelatin, tallow and semen, all with a view to re-establishing freedom of movement as quickly as possible.
The general feeling was in fact one of disappoint ment and of frustration, almost as though the leaders in Luxembourg themselves were the measure not only of a de facto crisis but, what is worse, of a crisis which extends beyond the limits of objectivity and generates the feeling of resignation as regards the crisis itself, and of powerlessness, even, of the inability of society to get to grips with reality, to sharpen its wits and bring out new ideas which measure up to the problems.

Mrs De March (COM), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy (in writing). — (FR) The plan to stimulate cooperation and scientific and technical inter change that has been put before us by the Commission is an attempt to get to grips with an underlying weak ness of research in Europe namely, the inadequacy of communication between scientific institutes and of cooperation between laboratories and universities, as well as the differences in scientific training and in research systems.
Similar problems, not in relation to property ownership but certainly in relation to impact on the environment, on heritage and, indeed, on people's quality of life are occurring as a result of major infrastructural developments in Ireland, and it seems to be an issue that we at European level have not been able to get to grips with because the European legislation is not stringent enough or, indeed, the Commission is not in a position to act fast enough in terms of addressing complaints when they are made.
As I am constantly emphasising at various opportunities, we really must get to grips with this and simplify matters, particularly in view of the fact that we need to make greater efforts to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises also take advantage of the opportunities that we want to provide by means of European funding and also, for example, the revolving funding that we want to offer more in the future; and we really need to look at how we can keep the red tape to a minimum.
Randzio-Plath (PSE), draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy. - (DE) Mr President, this report is highly significant, because ever since the beginning of the second stage of monetary union the European Parliament has been calling for an interinstitutional agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, so that in the excessive deficit procedures, and more particularly in the basic aspects of economic policy and its enforcement, we can get to grips with the problem of democratic deficit.

There is no escaping the impression that we have a European Union in which we can do anything we like with money, with goods and with services, but in which citizens are denied freedom of movement on the flimsiest of pretexts. Most of those pretexts are something to do with the fact that governments - and I am prepared to say so quite provocatively - are no longer able to get to grips with their problems of internal policy, whether economic or social, so that they arrange their border controls as a theatrical production in order to calm their own populations, saying in effect, ' Everything's under control on the crime front provided we have enough policemen at the borders.'
However, since in spite of the absences there was a keen desire and willingness to go into this problem, which is one of the fundamental problems facing the Community, I should like to ask Mr Davignon if he could find time among his many commitments to give a further explanation at a meeting of the Committee on External Economic Relations or of the Political Affairs Committee so that there can be an exchange of views and we can hear his answers and his ideas, so as to really get to grips with this problem. Consequently, Mr President, I should be happy to accept the idea of not voting on the motions for resolutions at this point in time, in view of the fact that we have not even been able to hear Mr Davignon's answers.
= > The completion of the Single Market and the introduction of the single currency are transforming Europe from a group of separate economies into an integrated economic entity. The realisation of economic and monetary union will bring advantages for Europe in terms of greater macroeconomic stability, sustainable growth and a stronger voice on the world stage. This new economic framework will make the interplay between social and economic policy even more important, accentuating the need to strengthen the links between EMU, a well-functioning Single Market, cohesion policy, and employment and social policy. In particular, EMU will help to reinforce transparency and competition, thereby contributing to more dynamic growth, and employment, helping to underpin social progress. = > Demographic trends mean that the workforce and the population of the European Union are, on average, getting older. The changing balance between the working and the retired population poses a major challenge to economic and social cohesion. Further efforts are needed to spread awareness of and get to grips with the full implications of this Page 9
