That Say Uncle thing.
Each week on Say Uncle, we find out if you have what it takes to take the pain and win cash and prizes, or will you say uncle and go home empty-handed, disappointing your family and crushing your dreams?
Say Uncle will be right back.
Say Uncle Sal I feel good.
Or should I say Uncle Officer Ravitz?
