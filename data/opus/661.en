Don't expect to hit the hay until at least 6am!Sunday morning at El Rastro On Sundays and holidays, the area between Plaza Tirso de Molina and Glorieta de Embajadores holds the country's most famous open-air market.
And I gotta hit the hay too, cos I got a few things I gotta do tomorrow.
All right, precious. You'd better hit the hay and get a good night's rest.
Well actually, Butters, I think we'd better hit the hay pretty soon.
Everyone hit the hay now.
Well, Skip, we usually hit the hay about now, so...
I'm... just going to hit the hay early.
I'm tired. Gonna hit the hay early.
