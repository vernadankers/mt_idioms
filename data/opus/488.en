The place to be for online poker action in February is Full Tilt Poker.

Since relaunch Full Tilt Poker has seen traffic numbers as high as 8,000 players and as low as their current number of just over 3,000.

In the past couple years Blom has managed to maintain his relevancy even if he hasn’t been the catalyst of million-dollar pots (during his 2009 Full Tilt run Blom was a part of the 10 largest pots in online poker history) through his sponsorship with PokerStars, his Superstar Showdown Challenge Matches, and most recently his return to Full Tilt Poker (this time as a sponsored pro) and to his ultra-swingy ways, once again providing the poker world with million-dollar up- and downswings.
