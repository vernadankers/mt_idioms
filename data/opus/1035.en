The flux measures the rate of flow of energy that passes through each cm^2 (or any unit area) of an object 's surface each second. The detected flux depends on the distance from the source that radiates the energy. This is because the energy has to spread over a volume of space before it reaches us. Let us assume that we have an imaginary balloon that encloses a star. Each dot on the balloon represents a unit of energy emitted from the star. Initially, the dots in an area of one cm^2 are in close proximity to each other and the flux (energy emitted per square centimetre per second) is high. After a distance d, the volume and surface area of the balloon increased causing the dots to spread away from each. Consequently, the number of dots (or energy) enclosed in one cm^2 has decreased as illustrated in Figure 1.
Who wants to try to make a miracle would literally “ throw ” the feeling , that is, they should be good to break away from if , but , who knows, perhaps ; and if you could try this strange feeling feel a tremor in his heart , not a breath or tachycardia course , something different and you notice it because at the same time perceive something out of his head , It is the energy mind that because of the force of the feeling abandon him for a fraction of a second , and this will allow the energy of the heart to radiate . It is that process already called “ synchronous interaction ” between our three souls , and that in the sacred images is referenced in the cross placed on the ball or the height of the “ scepter ” ( come in “ Glorification of the Eucharist ” the scepter held by the Son ).
this time you saw the bull moving off to one side falling down the vertical reference line as it did in the constant velocity case but suppose you were in the six telerate a frame of reference how could you explain this gravity is the only force acting on this fall so it should fall straight down but at the law of inertia is to hold there must be a farce pushing sideways on the ball in this direction accorded to deviate from the vertical path but what kind of a force is it it is not gravitational or an electric or nuclear force in fact it is in the force at all as we know what story left to conclude but it gets sensor is no force that could be pushing in this direction on the ball but the law governorship just does not hold this is a strange frame of reference we call a frame of reference in which the law of inertia holes and inertial the law how the nurse or holds in the third frame of reference so it is an inertial frame the car moving at constant velocity relative to the earth is an inertial frame but the car which is expel a rated is not an inertial frame because the frame of reference that we're used to living in is one in which the law of inertia holds when we go into a non inertial
