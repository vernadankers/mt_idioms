In the short run the Commission is endeavouring to improve the situation as regards information and consultation rights for workers within the more general context of work on the proposal for a Directive concerning undertakings with complex structures, in particular transnational undertakings (the 'Vredeling' proposal).
In the short run, though, it runs up against the economic difficulties many of the countries of eastern and central Europe are facing and the fact that in sectors such as textiles and agriculture, producers in Cyprus have few comparative advantages over their foreign competitors.
In the absence of central bank independence , monetary policy cannot be credibly geared to price stability since it can at any time be exposed to political preferences to boost output in the short run at the expense of higher inflation in the longer run .
The practical influence of the availability of external powers on cooperation is however variable. Many cooperation examples demonstrate that problems related to a restrictive national legal framework can be partly compensated in the short run by aspects such as high motivation and flexible or pragmatic action.
In the short run there is likely to be an increase in crossborder health care and a further growth in the already considerable private sector health market under which nationals travel to other countries for treatment which is more readily available than in their own Member States.
Step by step, the PBoC is enabling increased international use of the RMB. Although the goal to make the RMB a true global currency by 2019 provides plenty of opportunities for corporates, the drawback of liberalization is a more volatile currency, at least in the short run.
On the other hand, the objective of opening up all telephone subscriber services to competition cannot be achieved in the short run as long as incumbent operators are not obliged to grant their rivals access to the "last mile" in the telephone network : the local loop.
Environmentally sustainable but economically less profitable traditional pole-and-line fishing gear had to compete with modern technologies and extremely sophisticated resources that were incomparably more profitable in the short run but environmentally unsustainable, and some discriminatory measures against the latter type of vessel are finally only emerging now.
EMU relaxes the constraints on fiscal policy in the short run (because there is easier and wider access to borrowing at lower interest rates) but it makes the long run constraint more strict (because there is no longer any escape route in printing money to service the debt).
Such pupils may be adversely affected at least in the short run by interrupted schooling or by having to face linguistic and cultural difference; however, longer-term prospects for their education success look good and their exposure to new cultures and languages is likely to enhance their human capital.
The economic policy pursued during 1983 and envisaged for 1984 aims primarily at reinforcing the competitive parts of the economy and at improving resource allocation, and thus the overall performance in the longer term, even though there will be some dampening effects on economic activity in the short run.
Moreover, adding these new and completely different operational tasks to the Agency’s mandate may turn out to be very challenging in the short run and there is a significant risk that the agency would not be able to carry out this kind of task properly within a reasonable time-span.
Assuming that these means of enrichment are produced within the EC, in the short run the effect of this enrichment will be for the total wine production to decrease in volume, but to go up accordingly in alcoholic strength and probably to fetch a higher market price per litre.
It is the largest source at 65% of global nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas with approximately 300 times the warming potential of CO2.#SMCH Methane does much more damage in the short run, but if we stop it, we will be able to reverse the trend of global warming very fast.
This means that it should be possible to apply the Regulation in such a way that the long-term beneficial impact on competitiveness, growth and employment as such is a valid ground for authorising a merger, even if the concentration in the short run could have some negative effects on competition.
The ludicrous situation thus being created is that although money is being saved in the short run by holding onto stocks, this is being done in full know ledge of the fact that postponing sales while stocks continue to accumulate can only mean even greater losses in the longer run.
There is a need for ambitious growth and employment measures and an investment policy focusing on both a re-launch in the short run and a structural transformation of the European economy to respond to the fundamental challenges of sustainability, more and better jobs, upwards social convergence and innovation based competitiveness.
So, if we want a quicker cooling of the planet we have to eliminate those that leave the atmosphere quickly.71 In other words, methane does much more damage in the short run, but if we stop it, we will be able to reverse the trend of global warming very fast.
Finally the Union industry, in consideration of its profitability figures during the period considered, justified that the closure in mid-2008 of the sole French producer had, in the short run, diminished the quantity of product concerned available in the domestic market, thus temporarily increasing sales prices and, accordingly, increasing their profitability.
While there is a broad consensus among both academics and policy-makers on the need for fiscal discipline to ensure the smooth functioning of EMU and provide conditions conducive to growth and employment creation, concerns have been expressed that budgetary consolidation could have a negative effect on output in the short run.
Although the moderate increases in nominal income now envisaged may help to sustain competitiveness and thus contribute to a lasting improvement in the conditions for growth and employment, the fall in private disposable income will evidently, in the short run, have a negative impact on demand and output and so increase unemployment.
We are going to present a package - which is being worked on at the moment - where we identify the different policy fields where we think we can mitigate the impact on the real economy in the short run, whilst sticking to the existing medium-term reform priorities of the Lisbon Strategy.
There is a need for ambitious growth and employment measures and an investment policy focusing both on a re-launch in the short run as well as a structural transformation of the European economy to respond to the fundamental challenges of sustainability, more and better jobs, upwards social convergence and innovation based competitiveness.
In the short run, though, some of the new Member States may need to make choices: higher spending on infrastructure, training or R & D can make it harder to contain budget deficits, and tax and pension reforms introducing funded pillars recorded outside the government sector may also involve up-front budgetary costs.
It is difficult to predict what this would entail, or how the monetary authorities would react, but in view of the sizable financing requirement of several sectors in the United States, a rapid weakening of the dollar could conceivably mean a fresh upward twist in interest rates, at least in the short run.
… focus on the mediumterm … As the transmission lags make it impossible for monetary policy to offset unanticipated shocks to the price level (for example, those caused by changes in international commodity prices or indirect taxes) in the short run, some shortterm volatility in inflation rates is inevitable (see also Section 4.4).
The Norwegian authorities furthermore argue that it is reasonable to believe that a regional increase in the social security contributions will, in the short run, only to a very limited extent be shifted through increased product prices or reduced wage costs, because of the delay in adjusting the economic activity to the new situation.
For action in the short run, the Council and Commission have established a consensus on the list of transport projects to be financed under the appropriations of the 1983 and 1984 budgets. These mainly involve road projects leading to or across major frontier crossings, and railway investments that concern principal European axes of traffic.
While the most immediate impact on growth and jobs in the short run needs to come from a monetary and fiscal stimulus, a comprehensive recovery plan also needs to encompass an ambitious structural reform agenda tailored to the needs of individual Member States, and designed to equip them to emerge stronger from the crisis.
The current policy mix of austerity and flexibility needs to be traded in for an investment policy focusing both on a relaunch in the short run as well as a structural transformation of the European economy to respond to the fundamental challenges of sustainability, more and better jobs, upwards social convergence and innovation based competitiveness.
In the short run, the central bank can influence real economic developments In the short run, a change in money market (i.e. short-term) interest rates induced by the central bank sets a number of mechanisms in motion, mainly because this change has an impact on the spending and saving decisions taken by households and firms.
And while there are still many aspects of its functioning unclear, the fundamental design is clear and approved: the ECB will be the supervisor, a kind of EU wide resolution mechanism with EU fiscal backstop will exist, and an EU wide deposit guarantee fund will come later on, but is not indispensable in the short run.
In the short run at least price elasticities of demand tend to be very low for most primary products and probably also for the majority of service transactions, with the notable exception of tourism. As a result the effect of changes in relative costs and prices tends to be felt mainly in trade in manufactured goods.
Of course, more competition also leads to restructuring, with the weakest going to the wall, which inevitably results in the short term in plant closures and job losses. In such circumstances there can be no getting away from the fact that measures to promote com petitiveness are in some cases, at least in the short run, job-destroying.
-— if a complete study was not made, the company (15) would have to provide sufficient circumstantial evidence to demonstrate that it has actively pursued an alternative location which would in the short run have been more cost efficient but was not pursued for specific reasons and the Commission's experts would then have to verify this evidence.
Changes in the quantity of factors of production and their relative proportions employed in the economy will determine the growth and productivity of the economic system in the short run, but from the point of view of the competitiveness of modern industrial economies, changes in the quality of the factors of production are more important in the medium term.
Many questions need to be answered in the short run, such as the dose­effect relation of a very large number of pol­lutants and nuisances, the short and long term effects of exposure to often rela­tively low concentrations or doses, the results of the interaction or synergisms of environmental nuisances, the behav­iour of pollutants in the environment, the transfer mechanisms, etc.
What's going to happen in the end, it's not going to be just humans colonizing space, it's going to be life moving out from the Earth, moving it into its kingdom. And the kingdom of life, of course, is going to be the universe. And if life is already there, it makes it much more exciting, in the short run.
In response to the Commission's memorandum ' of 1982 on the reduction and reorganization of working time the European Parliament adopted a Resolution on 28 April 1983 recommending in the short run a significant reduction in working time, taking account of national circumstances and the circumstances of individual sectors and firms, and implemented in a way that avoids cost increases.
In other countries, there is clearly a need for extra resources and thus increased public and private expenditure, at least in the short run; however, this extra funding does not necessarily come from higher total public spending but also from a fair distribution of costs between businesses, individuals and public budgets, and from a shift of public spending across policy priorities.
Of course, Britain can manage in the short run outside the euro, but over time, we stand to lose out: our businesses are handicapped in the European market by conversion costs and hedging costs that their competitors in that market do not face; and inward investors into the European market will prefer to be in the major currency area rather than the smaller one.
Even though it is the case that poverty is linked to AlDS, in the sense that Africa is poor and they have a lot of AlDS, it's not necessarily the case that improving poverty -- at least in the short run, that improving exports and improving development -- it's not necessarily the case that that's going to lead to a decline in HlV prevalence.
Aggregate supply and the price level in the short run As indicated by its name, aggregate supply deals with the supply of goods and services produced by firms.We first need to understand how the overall level of prices is related to the overall level of output in the short run, i.e. assuming that all other factors (production technology, nominal wages, etc.) remain the same.
Even though it is the case that poverty is linked to AIDS, in the sense that Africa is poor and they have a lot of AIDS, it's not necessarily the case that improving poverty -- at least in the short run, that improving exports and improving development -- it's not necessarily the case that that's going to lead to a decline in HIV prevalence.
The overall objective of the Task Force was to provide an overview of the main investment trends and needs; analyse the main barriers and bottlenecks to investment; propose practical solutions to overcome those barriers and bottlenecks; identify strategic investments with EU added value that could be undertaken in the short run; and make recommendations for developing a credible and transparent pipeline for the medium to long term.
The Commission makes clear in a number of points that wholly unsustainable uses may well be highly profitable from an economic perspective, noting, for instance, that "forests are destroyed because it is more profitable in the short run to use land for other purposes than to keep them standing" and that "profitable alternative uses of land with a high market value, such as obtaining commodities, provide incentives for deforestation".
To the extent possible , a distinction is made between measures which improve the budgetary outcome in one year only 35 and therefore require compensation in the following year ( one-off measures ) , and measures which have the same implication in the short run but in addition lead to extra borrowing in later years , thereby first improving and later burdening the budget ( self-reversing measures ) .

However, to respect the 3% target for 1997, it is important that action be taken to keep spending to planned levels, both to compen­sate for the fiscal slippage in 1995 and for an expected less rapid budgetary improvement in the short run which is partly due to lower growth than previously predicted. Finally, in Spain and Portugal, a deter­mined implementation of the budgetary component of the convergence programmes is required.
To the extent possible , a distinction is made between measures which improve the budgetary outcome in one year only and therefore require compensation in the following year (" one-off » measures ) , and measures which have the same implication in the short run but , in addition , lead to extra borrowing in later years , thereby first improving and later burdening the budget (" self-reversing » measures ) .
In the short run, it provides room for the automatic stabilisers to operate freely and cushion the effect of economic shocks; in the medium-run it creates room for budgetary manoeuvre to either cut taxes or divert expenditures to more productive items such as investment and R & D; in the long-run, compliance will help Member States meet the budgetary costs of ageing population while securing adequate and accessible pensions and health care.
The deployment of a targeted and well-coordinated policy response to the crisis, as outlined by the European Economic Recovery Plan4 (EERP) adopted by the Commission on 26 November 2008, must therefore be seized as an opportunity for concerted efforts to overcome the recession by supporting economic activity in the short run and through reforms geared at strengthening investment in a more sustainable economy and society and putting age-related spending on a sustainable path5.
Some aspects of flexicurity are even more essential in the short run: reinforce activation schemes in particular for the low-skilled; enhanced job subsidies and short training courses for vulnerable groups and those most at risk of long-term unemployment; providing (re)training and new skills needed in less hit sectors; adequate social protection that provides income security, incentives to work and preserving purchasing power; harmonised labour contracts that reduce segmentation while avoiding the temptation to create 'flexible' contracts.
Contribute to a policy-mix that is compatible with price stability and the need to enhanceconfidence among business and consumers in the short run as well as with economicgrowth close to potential in the medium term.Maintain budgetary positions of close to balance or in surplus throughout the economiccycle in cyclicallyadjusted terms, and as long as this has not yet been achieved, take allthe necessary measures to ensure an annual improvement in the cyclicallyadjusted budgetposition of at least 0.5% of GDP.
In the short run very little, but in the longer run (if that is given to us) the only way to change the sketched situation in a rational and reasonable way is to use existing science in a better way and to make better use the scientific methods of rational reasoning; by giving the greatest possible number the best possible education; by keeping the centers of science and culture, and especially the universities, as autonomous and scientific as possible instead of making them subservient to the state's bureaucracues or to popular political madness; and by striving for a political order in which the major social and governmental priorities are these:
These objectives are aimed both at inviting the industry to make the investment needed in order to bring the efficiency level of cross-border retail payments closer to that of domestic payment systems and at endeavouring to strike a balance between what is expected by users and what the industry can realistically deliver in the short run . One indication that the markets are starting to address the problem is the EBA 's Low-Value Payments ( LVP ) initiative , which is aimed at developing a service for the processing of cross-border retail payments in euro and would , in the early stages , be based on the technical capabilities of Euro 1 .
Guideline No 6. To contribute to a dynamic and well-functioning EMU, euro area Member States need to ensure better coordination of their economic and budgetary policies, in particular, 1. pay particular attention to fiscal sustainability of their public finances in full compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact; 2. contribute to a policy mix that supports economic recovery and is compatible with price stability, and thereby enhances confidence among business and consumers in the short run, while being compatible with long term sustainable growth; 3. press forward with structural reforms that will increase euro area long-term potential growth and will improve its productivity, competitiveness and economic adjustment to asymmetric shocks, paying particular attention to employment policies, and 4. ensure that the euro area’s influence in the global economic system is commensurate with its economic weight.
Things are quite different in practice and, from one budget crisis to another, a number of devices have been resorted to in order to circumvent these limits, by deferring expenditure for which funds were not immediately available: the accounting arrangements for agricultural stocks are such that, in the very short term, it is much less of a burden on the Community budget to increase stocks of agricultural products than to market them; the growth of commitment appropriations and of payment appropriations are not subject to the same constraints, so that, again in the short run, the former may increase much faster than the latter, though the commitments have nonetheless to be honoured in the end; and the arrangements for carrying over appropriations from year to year allow certain adjustments to be made, which also generate expenditure in the future.
ACKNOWLEDGES that addressing the additional adaptation needs to prevent and alleviate the current and projected negative impacts of climate change will entail economic costs in the short run and require appropriate funding; UNDERLINES that delays in taking adequate adaptation action are likely to generate even higher costs and, negative impacts on sectoral outputs, on employment, health and infrastructure, with differential impacts at national and regional level; ACKNOWLEDGES the need to target the most cost effective adaptation measures, to increase climate resilience across the economy, based on consistent economic and vulnerability assessment frameworks; ACKNOWLEDGES that effective adaptation action should facilitate more climate resilient investments and more sustainable choices for investment – both private and public , and is expected to create new market opportunities for sustainable growth and job creation; RECALLS the Conclusions of the European Council on 7-8 February on the Multi-annual Financial Framework underlining the importance of further mainstreaming the climate action objectives in the future EU budget; UNDERLINES that within national public sector frameworks, further initiatives by the private sector action are needed, including by the insurance industry to managing climate risk, in order to complement public intervention on adaptation."
