Because of the prevailing spirit of independence and rebellion against established authority and those in control, many young people today feel that they can kick over the traces and successfully resist all such influences.
A guy that can kick over the traces and win the world for me!
Those who ‘ kick over the traces ’ by going beyond their relative freedom may think they are making a break for greater freedom, perhaps attaining absolute freedom as great as God’s.
But sometimes it is time to kick over the traces like in this video of Gérard*, of a voluntarily gig in the foyer of the Comedia Theatre in Cologne during the Gay Games. As for singing technique far from good, but wás it fun.
