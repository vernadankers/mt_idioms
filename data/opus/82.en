As to the 1995 budget, we must keep to the guidelines adopted at the time — such as multiannual planning of administrative expenditure, consideration of the impact of certain items of expenditure on subsequent years, or interinstitutional cooperation — and we must also bear in mind particularly their effects with regard to the enlargement of the Union.
It will be necessary to address issues which have surfaced recently, such as the subprime crisis and fuel and food prices, but when we do so we must bear in mind that the our circumstances are sounder, that next year we will celebrate the tenth anniversary of the euro and that we must strengthen international economic cooperation.
Another important consideration here is that the Member States are free to set rates at between 50 % and 100 % of the maximum figure. We should also bear in mind that five years will have elapsed between the fixing of the present maximum rates and the introduction of the new maximum rates on 1 January 1999.
I ask him therefore, before answering our rapporteur, to bear in mind that this Parliament is prepared to take a very strong public position, such as the blocking of this regulation here today — with a further referral back to committee — until the Council's representatives are genuinely prepared to re-examine the working of the TACIS pro gramme.
We should also bear in mind that five years will have'elapsed between the fixing of the present maximum rates and the introduction of the new maximum rates on 1 January 1999. The committee is therefore proposing a substantial increase in the maximum annual charges, to between ECU 1500 for environmentally friendly vehicles and ECU 2500 for polluting vehicles.
Finally, however, it is necessary to bear in mind the Eastern European time zone which includes Finland, Greece and those eastern countries that have already applied for membership of the European Union; for those countries, it is not realistic to hold out any prospect of a European Community, in the near future, with a uniform timetable for summer time.

The first is that we should produce food in order to eat it and not to stockpile it ; the second is that we should bear in mind the need to preserve the beauties of our country side, and that is why I attach such importance to the amendments put forward by my colleague, Mr Collins, to the Bocklet report.
All, therefore, bear in mind Paul’s counsel in Romans 12: 3: “For through the undeserved kindness given to me I tell everyone there among you not to think more of himself than it is necessary to think; but to think so as to have a sound mind, each one as God has distributed to him a measure of faith. ”
However, it is important to bear in mind that the Structural Funds must be tools for development and social cohesion, not weapons for a war between our regions, because, even in the richest countries in the European Union, there are still poor regions where workers watch with despair as their jobs disappear, often leaving them with no possibility of retraining.

should bear in mind during the second reading — and, others will certainly follow — such as copyright and neighbouring rights concerning satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission, or harmonization of the period during which copyright and neighbouring rights are protected —, it is important that certain basic points be defined in this first directive which, we hope, will soon come into force.
I would, however, ask you to bear in mind that the Commission's coordination of these measures by the Member States is not a simple task, particularly when some Member States were late in submitting their national measures — which they adopted only two or three day ago — or when the measures they have submitted are incomplete and require additions or clarification. cation.
Therefore, from this point of view, conditionality via monitoring is increased, and I believe that I was attempting, in this proposal, to bear in mind, as you are doing, certain specific cases in which what was happening on the ground in relation to social rights did not necessarily comply with the spirit of the agreements between the Union and the countries in question.
In any event, I am very interested to hear the opinion of Parlacen, the Central American Parliament, and of Central America's political organisations, and my hope is that, when the negotiation begins, the European Commission will bear in mind that what Central America is asking for is not a carbon copy of the United States' position, but an equidistant, different and autonomous position.

While I feel it is right that the Commission should take an initiative designed to strike a better regional balance, I also think it is important to bear in mind in this context not only that there can be new privileges in our Community but also that old privileges enshrined in the customs code must remain in place where regions are affected by them.

However, we must also bear in mind - and I think that many non-governmental organisations are highlighting this fact - that if there had been housing in this area that was not substandard, a civic network that could have predicted what could happen and, in short, if there had been greater consolidation of human rights in that area, the hurricane would not have been as devastating.

In debating the proposals that have been tabled today, both in the Council of Ministers and in the European Parliament, we must bear in mind our own commitments, of which the most important is that we take care, that our objective is achieved when we decide all the details, in other words that the global temperature does not rise by two degrees in comparison with the pre-industrial era.

To Mrs Hoff, I would say that much as we have to think in terms of overall European integration from the point of view of the European Parliament, much as we have to bear in mind the interests of the various republics, of the various minorities, and the interest of further develop ing and stabilizing both perestroika and a foreign policy on the part of Gorbachev which encourages peace, so
I would like to remind the Members of this House that they should not think only in terms of the big farmers they know about or the big corporations who own thousands and thousands of hectares. They should also bear in mind that the average farm in the European Community is still only 19 hectares, and that there are an awful lot of little ones that badly want an increase.
In reading this passage one should bear in mind that the law is formulated with the presumption that the deceased is a man; its provisions apply, mutatis mutandis, when the deceased is a woman.The system of inheritance which provides for distribution of the deceased's estate among seven categories of heirs (children, spouse, father, mother, brothers, sisters, and teachers) is based on the provisions set out by the Báb in the Bayán.
In interlingual translation, we nearly always need to translate not the meaning but the sense, it is therefore extremely important to bear in mind this distinction.But is it always possible to distinguish sense and meaning and, above all, remain mindful that sense is such a high entity as to remain expressible independent of its linguistic and cultural context? On that point L'vovskaja is optimistic, because she feels that one should answer "yes".
Lastly, with respect to easyJet's responsibility for your use of the app, when you're using the real-time airport data push notifications ("Go to Gate" and "Bag Reclaim") function of the app, it's important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you.
However bear in mind since this is the heart of Barcelona there will be some inevitable street noise, so I recommend you choose a hotel with double glazing and choose a floor in the hotel that is as high up from ground level as possible.Although we cannot recommend individual hotels we have written comprehensive reviews of some of the most popular hotels in Barcelona and linked these reviews to a Barcelona Hotel Map.
Furthermore, if we bear in mind that the essential thing is to educate and inform young people, who will be the real protagonists of the European Union within a few years and who will be its future, and that it is they who sporting information can mostly reach, we would truly be completing a circle which would be of the greatest interest and benefit in terms of the image of all the institutions of the European Union.
It is especially important for us to bear in mind that Georgia is currently making great efforts to obtain both financial and security-related support from Russia, France and Germany, as well as from the World Bank; that a sound legal environment for the privatization of state-run undertakings has been created; that the privatization of the agricultural sector is making rapid progress; and that by the end of 1996, some 90 % of the privatization of small businesses had been completed.
The organiser should also bear in mind differences in trainees’ living environment: for instance, training a group of people from different countries with different socio-cultural environments may bring into play organisational or methodological considerations that do not apply when training a group of people from the same region. Likewise, if the organiser is aware of market barriers in the community, s/he may decide to give more room in the training curriculum to aspects that are not so critical for trainees who enjoy excellent AT service delivery.
Thus, as well as the special envoy, I think that the time has come for the European Union to set up a task force consisting of representatives from the Commission, the Council and, yes why not, the European Parliament - after all we have two eminent parliamentary representatives from countries in the region here today - to work out detailed proposals and positions on specific issues being addressed during the current peace process and on any issues which we need to bear in mind in the period following the agreement.
For example, we have to bear in mind the need to boost public and private investment for productive purposes - an essential aspect of increasing the productivity and competitiveness of the European economy; we must pay attention to and strengthen essential aspects of research and development, education and professional training; and, obviously, we must take account of all those aspects which can make this Europe, strengthened by the euro, competitive at an internal level - or in other words, see that it offers more opportunities for the economies which can adapt to the new demands.
With regard to the distribution of resources, we have to take account of the need to show solidarity with countries which are highly committed to the question of refugees, but we also have to bear in mind - as the report says - the need for countries which have less of a tradition of accepting refugees - such as my own - to improve their infrastructures and services so that they may reach the same level as the other countries and take on - because I believe this should be the objective - higher levels of responsibility together with the other countries of the European Union.
Technology as a factor in growth and competition diture on R & TD by the Member States and just 2% of private and public expenditure together. The Union itself is keen to stress that R & TD remains primarily a matter for industry and the Member States. This guideline was firmly established under the Maastricht Treaty by the principle of subsidiarity, which holds that the Union should intervene only when action by the next tier of authority down is less suitable or less rational. More and more scientific problems in the economy, society, the environment and medicine are now proving to be insoluble within national boundaries. Even with the principle of subsidiarity, the scope for intervention by the Union therefore still far exceeds its capacities. The main features of European cooperation on R & TD In practical terms, anyone interested in the European Union's technical R & D programmes should bear in mind the following points:
