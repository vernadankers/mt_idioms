let's just assume for now that 's not something that we are consciously aware of and it's something that we are going to discuss later on for now le's just call it the thought realm when you're doing something you start by thinking about it whether you are building a pool in the backyard or making a sandwhich you have to have thought of it first even the subconscious thoughts for things like walking and breathing this shouldn't be anything new to us, we think of things before we do them even of it's a split second before them, this is just how we function, and our pyisical actions match the thoughts that we created you might say that you move through your thoughts turning non physical ideas into physical actions when an inventor gets an idea this idea can quickly spread throughout all of his colleagues and friends ideas and thoughts are spreadable multiple people can hold on to the same idea at once allowing then to grow and develop further in this scenario, don't think of thoughts as separate, but as a whole that everyone is latching on to of course, because we can't physically see this realm of toughts we can't tell exactly what the original idea was only the interpretation that they described using functions like speech and body languaje as well as our own intuition which is how thoughts connect to each other because of this, we add a bit of our own creation to the mix, our own spice while still working towards the same common goal a social gathering is another good example of this at work too people gathering together because they share the same ideas, toughts and emotions as the rest of the people there an example could be a college course on architecture people interested in architecture would attend the course, because they share the same interest mentally this shouldn't be anything mind blowing, it's our day to day lives, just from a different perspective even if you are using something that someone else made you are still creating this experience for yourself you manifested that iPad, or house, or whatever into your experiences so with thoughts connecting with other thoughts comes our first big realization this new understanding of how intertwined we truly are we are not only connected in the physical realm but in a mental and spiritual way as well up until recently humankind has always understood simply that they were only connected only through their physical being we assumed that the conscious experience, as well as all of the thinking was totally 100% isolated from the rest of everyone else the fact is: we are not we are so connected with each other, it is almost impossible to believe think about almost every creature on earth what do we really know about the bond that connects them? geese are able to travel long distances switching who flies in front like clockwork many fish swim in large schools and we know they do not have a form of verbal communication our pets are able to communicate with each other without speaking yet, it's like they know what each other are feeling and connect in their own very amazing personal way almost every observable creature on earth has connection with at least their own species, if not others we as humans are the next step in life, but that does not mean we do not have this connection what is to say we are not also connected to each other in this way? we have been out of touch with ourselves for ain incredibly long time now and we are growing increasingly disharmonic now, thoughts being created are just the tip of the iceberg the real interesting part comes when you look at emotions emotions are much more powerful than thoughts emotions pull on you, they control your actions they guide youy throughout your life it is not your thoughts that control where you sit in a classroom or on a bus but it is if you like that girl or you think that guy smells when a couple is together it is their emotions that keeps them tethered same when they are fighting, it is their emotions that break them apart you watch tv shows that you enjoy, you hang out with friends because you have emotional bonds with them now, this applies on a smaller scale too you ever had a morning when you wake up grumpy? and stump your toe and think: oooh this is going to be one of those days! and find that the entire day afterwards just goes terrible?, and just everything goes wrong? what about the days when you wake up excited and happy, ready to go? your whole day is just excellet in all of the right ways, even if something bad does happen, you are less affected by it because you are in such a good place emotionally the reason these differences in how your day goes is because your emotional state people like to think that the world will go on exactly the same without you but it really won't, people interact differently with other people and everyone would have a different experience if you were not there imagine this scenario: there is a bully on the playground looking for someone to beat on there are kids playing sports, kids skipping rope, kids on the swings and then off the side there is one boy sitting in the grass watching the rest of them playing he does not feel like anyone else would want to play with him, so he sits apart from the group the bully instantly knows where to go and the circle of hurting begins see?, it is through the feeling of being vulnerable that you become vulnerable in the physical if the boy had walked outside the recess and told himself:
