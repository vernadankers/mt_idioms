Abbreviation for R emote L ine P rinting R equest; this is a BSD-style printing system, that needs no root privileges to be installed, and no "printcap" to work: all parameters may be specified on the command line. RLPR comes in handy for many laptop users who are working in frequently changing environments. This is because it may be installed concurrently with every other printing sub system, and allows a very flexible and quick way to install a printer for direct access via LPR/ LPD. KDEPrint has an "Add Printer Wizard" to make RLPR usage even easier. The kprinter command allows switching to RLPR "on the fly" at any time.

kprinter is the new powerful print utility that is natively used by all & kde; applications. Contrary to some common misconceptions, kprinter is not a & CUPS; -only tool, but supports different print subsystems. You can even switch to a different print subsystem "on the fly", in between two jobs, without re-configuration. Of course, due to the powerful features of & CUPS;, kprinter is best suited for use with a & CUPS; frontend. kprinter is the successor to "qtcups", which is no longer being actively maintained. It has inherited all the best features of qtcups and added several new ones. MOST IMPORTANT: you can use kprinter with all its features in all non-kde; applications that allow a customized print command, like gv, Acrobat Reader, Netscape, Mozilla, Galeon, StarOffice, OpenOffice and all GNOME programs. kprinter can act as a "standalone" utility, started from an X-Terminal or a "Mini-CLI" to print many different files, from different folders, with different formats, in one job and simultaneously, without the need to first open the files in the applications! (File formats supported this way are & PostScript;, PDF, International and ASCII Text, as well as many different popular graphic formats, such as PNG, TIFF, JPEG, PNM, Sun RASTER, & etc;)
