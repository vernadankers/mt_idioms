All blood and thunder words.
The day of blood and thunder is coming.
The day of blood and thunder is indeed coming.
I was tremendously impressed by it's blood and thunder performance.
The first time I walked into your classroom, you were all blood and thunder.
Since their previous album 'Hymns Of Blood And Thunder' there has been a change in the line-up, drummer 'Iron' Bob Fouts has been replaced by former Sourvein skinsman 'Cool' Clyde Paradis.
The album is still as good as it was of course, but the two videoclips that have been added ('Iron Tusk' and 'Blood and Thunder') do not justify a second purchase.
You may have noticed that in general there is now a move away from the "blood and thunder" days, and at every level there is now a more peaceful approach to implementing the changes.
