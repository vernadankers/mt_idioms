‘ It's just that Uncle was a cautious old devil and —’ he looked away ‘ — he got the impression I was a bit of a spendthrift because — well, because I used to get through my allowance pretty rapidly when I was away at school, and … oh, hell, he wanted to make sure I was going to be dull and sensible about all that money when he finally kicked the bucket.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1	kick the bucket	figurative	inflection	PUNCT PRON ADV ADP PROPN VERB DET ADJ ADJ NOUN CCONJ ADV PRON VERB ADV PUNCT PUNCT PRON VERB DET NOUN PRON VERB DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP PUNCT INTJ ADP PRON VERB PART VERB ADP ADJ NOUN ADV ADV ADV PRON VERB ADV ADP NOUN CCONJ PUNCT INTJ NOUN PRON VERB PART VERB ADJ PRON VERB VERB PART VERB ADJ CCONJ ADJ ADP ADJ DET NOUN ADV PRON ADV VERB DET NOUN
