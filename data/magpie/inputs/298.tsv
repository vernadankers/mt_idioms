This is made crystal clear in a somewhat laboured exposition in a book by Preece and Maier published in 1889 : Let us suppose the two microphonic transmitters are placed on the stage at T and T 1, and these transmitters separately connected by two distinct wires to two telephone receivers, R and R 1, which are applied to both ears to hear the actor, whom we will suppose to be placed at A. It is easy to understand that, the distance of this actor from transmitter T being less than that from transmitter T 1, his song will be more distinctly reproduced by transmitter T than by T 1, and the stronger impression will be produced on the left ear.	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	crystal clear	figurative	identical	DET VERB VERB NOUN ADJ ADP DET ADV ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP PROPN CCONJ PROPN VERB ADP NUM PUNCT VERB PRON VERB DET NUM ADJ NOUN VERB VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP PROPN CCONJ PROPN NUM CCONJ DET NOUN ADV VERB ADP NUM ADJ NOUN ADP NUM NOUN NOUN NOUN CCONJ NOUN NUM ADJ VERB VERB ADP DET NOUN PART VERB DET NOUN NOUN PRON VERB VERB PART VERB VERB ADP NOUN PRON VERB ADJ PART VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN VERB ADJ ADP DET ADP NOUN PROPN NUM ADJ NOUN VERB VERB ADV ADV VERB ADP NOUN NOUN ADP ADP PROPN NUM CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN VERB VERB VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN	▁This ▁is ▁made ▁crystal ▁clear ▁in ▁a ▁somewhat ▁labour ed ▁ex position ▁in ▁a ▁book ▁by ▁Pre e ce ▁and ▁Ma ier ▁published ▁in ▁18 89 ▁ : ▁Let ▁us ▁suppose ▁the ▁two ▁micro phoni c ▁transmit ters ▁are ▁placed ▁on ▁the ▁stage ▁at ▁T ▁and ▁T ▁1 , ▁and ▁these ▁transmit ters ▁separately ▁connected ▁by ▁two ▁distinct ▁wires ▁to ▁two ▁telephone ▁receivers , ▁R ▁and ▁R ▁1 , ▁which ▁are ▁applied ▁to ▁both ▁ears ▁to ▁hear ▁the ▁act or , ▁whom ▁we ▁will ▁suppose ▁to ▁be ▁placed ▁at ▁A . ▁It ▁is ▁easy ▁to ▁understand ▁that , ▁the ▁distance ▁of ▁this ▁act or ▁from ▁transmit ter ▁T ▁being ▁less ▁than ▁that ▁from ▁transmit ter ▁T ▁1 , ▁his ▁so ng ▁will ▁be ▁more ▁distinct ly ▁reproduced ▁by ▁transmit ter ▁T ▁than ▁by ▁T ▁1 , ▁and ▁the ▁stronger ▁impression ▁will ▁be ▁produced ▁on ▁the ▁left ▁ear .	0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	DET VERB VERB NOUN ADJ ADP DET ADV ADJ ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP PROPN PROPN PROPN CCONJ PROPN PROPN VERB ADP NUM NUM PUNCT PUNCT VERB PRON VERB DET NUM ADJ ADJ ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP PROPN CCONJ PROPN NUM NUM CCONJ DET NOUN NOUN ADV VERB ADP NUM ADJ NOUN ADP NUM NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN CCONJ NOUN NUM NUM ADJ VERB VERB ADP DET NOUN PART VERB DET NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN PRON VERB VERB PART VERB VERB ADP NOUN NOUN PRON VERB ADJ PART VERB ADP ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN NOUN VERB ADJ ADP DET ADP NOUN NOUN PROPN NUM NUM ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB VERB ADV ADV ADV VERB ADP NOUN NOUN NOUN ADP ADP PROPN NUM NUM CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN VERB VERB VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN NOUN
