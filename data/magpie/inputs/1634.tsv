The rejoinder must be : although we may generally have neither the time nor the inclination to look at literary language under the microscope in this way, the fact that it can be done is important, and the doing of it can not fail to sharpen observation, by making us aware of how larger effects are built up from smaller ones.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	under the microscope	figurative	identical	DET NOUN VERB VERB PUNCT ADP PRON VERB ADV VERB CCONJ DET NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN PART VERB ADP ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN DET NOUN ADP PRON VERB VERB VERB VERB ADJ CCONJ DET NOUN ADP PRON VERB ADV VERB PART VERB NOUN ADP VERB PRON ADJ ADP ADV ADJ NOUN VERB VERB PART ADP ADJ NOUN
