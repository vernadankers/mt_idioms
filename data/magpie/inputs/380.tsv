Er well Madam Deputy Speaker I think erm that the last half an hour shown that er the quality of debate in this house er remains extremely high and that even when you have an issue which on the face of it looks to be as dry as dust er that er there are some honourable members who will pick an argument er when perhaps er on the face of it there ought not to be much of an argument er I can't erm I can't say that erm I agreed with much of what erm the honourable member for Great Grimsby said er he seemed to imply er quite early on his er speech that most of the City of London er was collapsing in a sea of sleaze and er er other other goings on which are extremely er to be regretted but erm I think we ought to er remind him er that erm, you know, all all of these four orders er followed the Bingham inquiry into er what happened at B C C I which was not a British bank, was an international bank based erm overseas and I think I 'm right in saying this and I 'm sure my honourable friend the
