So my answer to the question A is, I am not against a new settlement, of the right scale in the right location, but it is not a panacea, it is not an answer to all the questions, now it's being offered in terms of a balanced strategy, I say that balanced strategy as put forward does not work, certainly beyond two thousand and six, and may grind to a halt well before two thousand and six if rates of development proceed er as they have done in certain years in the past, so it's very important to look at that, can we just revisit the public acceptance of the new settlement, of course the public have accepted it and welcomed it, it has certain attractions, I support those attractions, however it's easy for the public to accept that when measured against certain sites specific proposals that were put to them when they did not know where the new settlement would be, and still do not know, when new settlement locations are put forward it will be quite a different scenario.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	grind to a halt	figurative	identical	ADV ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN VERB PRON VERB ADV ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN CCONJ PRON VERB ADV DET NOUN PRON VERB ADV DET NOUN ADP ADJ DET NOUN ADV PRON VERB VERB ADP NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PRON VERB ADP ADJ NOUN ADP VERB ADV VERB ADV VERB ADV ADP NUM NUM CCONJ NUM CCONJ VERB VERB ADP DET NOUN ADV ADP NUM NUM CCONJ NUM ADP NOUN ADP NOUN VERB INTJ ADP PRON VERB VERB ADP ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN CCONJ PRON ADV ADJ PART VERB ADP DET VERB PRON ADV VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN DET NOUN VERB VERB PRON CCONJ VERB PRON PRON VERB ADJ NOUN PRON VERB DET NOUN ADV PRON ADJ ADP DET NOUN PART VERB ADP ADV VERB ADP ADJ NOUN ADJ NOUN ADJ VERB VERB ADP PRON ADV PRON VERB ADV VERB ADV DET ADJ NOUN VERB VERB CCONJ ADV VERB ADV VERB ADV ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB VERB ADV PRON VERB VERB ADV DET ADJ NOUN	▁So ▁my ▁answer ▁to ▁the ▁question ▁A ▁is , ▁I ▁am ▁not ▁against ▁a ▁new ▁settlement , ▁of ▁the ▁right ▁scale ▁in ▁the ▁right ▁location , ▁but ▁it ▁is ▁not ▁a ▁pan acea , ▁it ▁is ▁not ▁an ▁answer ▁to ▁all ▁the ▁questions , ▁now ▁it ' s ▁being ▁offered ▁in ▁terms ▁of ▁a ▁balanced ▁strategy , ▁I ▁say ▁that ▁balanced ▁strategy ▁as ▁put ▁forward ▁does ▁not ▁work , ▁certainly ▁beyond ▁two ▁thousand ▁and ▁six , ▁and ▁may ▁grind ▁to ▁a ▁halt ▁well ▁before ▁two ▁thousand ▁and ▁six ▁if ▁rates ▁of ▁development ▁proceed ▁er ▁as ▁they ▁have ▁done ▁in ▁certain ▁years ▁in ▁the ▁past , ▁so ▁it ' s ▁very ▁important ▁to ▁look ▁at ▁that , ▁can ▁we ▁just ▁re vis it ▁the ▁public ▁acceptance ▁of ▁the ▁new ▁settlement , ▁of ▁course ▁the ▁public ▁have ▁accepted ▁it ▁and ▁welcomed ▁it , ▁it ▁has ▁certain ▁attraction s , ▁I ▁support ▁those ▁attraction s , ▁however ▁it ' s ▁easy ▁for ▁the ▁public ▁to ▁accept ▁that ▁when ▁measured ▁against ▁certain ▁sites ▁specific ▁proposals ▁that ▁were ▁put ▁to ▁them ▁when ▁they ▁did ▁not ▁know ▁where ▁the ▁new ▁settlement ▁would ▁be , ▁and ▁still ▁do ▁not ▁know , ▁when ▁new ▁settlement ▁locations ▁are ▁put ▁forward ▁it ▁will ▁be ▁quite ▁a ▁different ▁scenario .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	ADV ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN VERB VERB PRON VERB ADV ADP DET ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN NOUN CCONJ PRON VERB ADV DET NOUN NOUN NOUN PRON VERB ADV DET NOUN ADP ADJ DET NOUN NOUN ADV PRON PRON PRON VERB VERB ADP NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN NOUN PRON VERB ADP ADJ NOUN ADP VERB ADV VERB ADV VERB VERB ADV ADP NUM NUM CCONJ NUM NUM CCONJ VERB VERB ADP DET NOUN ADV ADP NUM NUM CCONJ NUM ADP NOUN ADP NOUN VERB INTJ ADP PRON VERB VERB ADP ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN CCONJ PRON PRON PRON ADV ADJ PART VERB ADP DET DET VERB PRON ADV VERB VERB VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP NOUN DET NOUN VERB VERB PRON CCONJ VERB PRON PRON PRON VERB ADJ NOUN NOUN NOUN PRON VERB DET NOUN NOUN NOUN ADV PRON PRON PRON ADJ ADP DET NOUN PART VERB ADP ADV VERB ADP ADJ NOUN ADJ NOUN ADJ VERB VERB ADP PRON ADV PRON VERB ADV VERB ADV DET ADJ NOUN VERB VERB VERB CCONJ ADV VERB ADV VERB VERB ADV ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB VERB ADV PRON VERB VERB ADV DET ADJ NOUN NOUN
