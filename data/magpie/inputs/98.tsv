With difficulty, but I think it is fair to say as well it has got great compensations, because if you build walls, if you 're hiding, if you 're pretending, if you 're always subscribing parents and stopping them from coming in you make problems ; parents worry and suspect that there are problems behind those closed doors, and I think this is why we have established fifteen different parent teacher groups which meet regularly in different parts of Sussex, from Seaford to Shoreham, to Hove, to Brighton, and in small groups of ten / fifteen / twenty they 'll sit down with a teacher and they don't just do fund raising they thrash out the different aspects of their children's education and then they come in and meet in a main committee and I think it is this involvement that enables the parents and the teachers to work very closely together.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	behind closed doors	figurative	insertion-determiner	ADP NOUN CCONJ PRON VERB PRON VERB ADJ PART VERB ADV ADV PRON VERB VERB ADJ NOUN ADP ADP PRON VERB NOUN ADP PRON VERB VERB ADP PRON VERB VERB ADP PRON VERB ADV VERB NOUN CCONJ VERB PRON ADP VERB ADP PRON VERB NOUN PUNCT NOUN VERB CCONJ VERB ADP ADV VERB NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN CCONJ PRON VERB DET VERB ADV PRON VERB VERB NUM ADJ NOUN NOUN NOUN ADJ VERB ADV ADP ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN ADP PROPN ADP PROPN ADP PROPN ADP PROPN CCONJ ADP ADJ NOUN ADP NUM SYM NUM SYM NUM PRON VERB VERB PART ADP DET NOUN CCONJ PRON VERB ADV VERB NOUN VERB PRON VERB PART DET ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN CCONJ ADV PRON VERB PART CCONJ VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN CCONJ PRON VERB PRON VERB DET NOUN ADJ VERB DET NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN PART VERB ADV ADV ADV	▁With ▁difficulty , ▁but ▁I ▁think ▁it ▁is ▁fair ▁to ▁say ▁as ▁well ▁it ▁has ▁got ▁great ▁compensation s , ▁because ▁if ▁you ▁build ▁walls , ▁if ▁you ▁' re ▁hiding , ▁if ▁you ▁' re ▁pretend ing , ▁if ▁you ▁' re ▁always ▁sub scribing ▁parents ▁and ▁stopping ▁them ▁from ▁coming ▁in ▁you ▁make ▁problems ▁ ; ▁parents ▁worry ▁and ▁suspect ▁that ▁there ▁are ▁problems ▁behind ▁those ▁closed ▁doors , ▁and ▁I ▁think ▁this ▁is ▁why ▁we ▁have ▁established ▁fifteen ▁different ▁parent ▁teacher ▁groups ▁which ▁meet ▁regularly ▁in ▁different ▁parts ▁of ▁Sussex , ▁from ▁Sea ford ▁to ▁Sho re ham , ▁to ▁Ho ve , ▁to ▁B right on , ▁and ▁in ▁small ▁groups ▁of ▁ten ▁/ ▁fifteen ▁/ ▁twenty ▁they ▁' ll ▁sit ▁down ▁with ▁a ▁teacher ▁and ▁they ▁don ' t ▁just ▁do ▁fund ▁raising ▁they ▁th rash ▁out ▁the ▁different ▁aspects ▁of ▁their ▁children ' s ▁education ▁and ▁then ▁they ▁come ▁in ▁and ▁meet ▁in ▁a ▁main ▁committee ▁and ▁I ▁think ▁it ▁is ▁this ▁involvement ▁that ▁enables ▁the ▁parents ▁and ▁the ▁teachers ▁to ▁work ▁very ▁closely ▁together .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	ADP NOUN NOUN CCONJ PRON VERB PRON VERB ADJ PART VERB ADV ADV PRON VERB VERB ADJ NOUN NOUN NOUN ADP ADP PRON VERB NOUN NOUN ADP PRON VERB VERB VERB VERB ADP PRON VERB VERB VERB VERB VERB ADP PRON VERB VERB ADV VERB VERB NOUN CCONJ VERB PRON ADP VERB ADP PRON VERB NOUN PUNCT PUNCT NOUN VERB CCONJ VERB ADP ADV VERB NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN NOUN CCONJ PRON VERB DET VERB ADV PRON VERB VERB NUM ADJ NOUN NOUN NOUN ADJ VERB ADV ADP ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN PROPN ADP PROPN PROPN ADP PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN ADP PROPN PROPN PROPN ADP PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN CCONJ ADP ADJ NOUN ADP NUM SYM NUM SYM NUM PRON VERB VERB VERB PART ADP DET NOUN CCONJ PRON VERB VERB VERB ADV VERB NOUN VERB PRON VERB VERB PART DET ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN CCONJ ADV PRON VERB PART CCONJ VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN CCONJ PRON VERB PRON VERB DET NOUN ADJ VERB DET NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN PART VERB ADV ADV ADV ADV
