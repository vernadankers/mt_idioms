A Microsoft Corp staffer is reported to have told Sun Microsystems Inc that Microsoft would make Windows such a moving target that Sun, with its WABI Windows Application Binary Interface, could not keep up ( CI No 2,147 ) : if the tale is true and Microsoft means it, it means that the company has learned a little too well from its long cohabitation with IBM, and that the seeds of its own destruction are now being sown — for years, IBM added features and tweaked its mainframes with no thought of improving them from the user's point of view, but simply to trip up competitors, and once a dominant company starts resorting to such tactics, it fatally injures the regard with which it is held by the outside world, and is embarking on the slippery slope that leads to the debacle IBM finds itself in today.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	slippery slope	figurative	identical	DET PROPN PROPN NOUN VERB VERB PART VERB VERB PROPN PROPN PROPN ADP PROPN VERB VERB PROPN ADJ DET VERB NOUN ADJ PROPN ADP ADJ PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN VERB ADV VERB PART PUNCT PROPN PROPN NUM PUNCT PUNCT ADP DET NOUN VERB ADJ CCONJ PROPN VERB PRON PRON VERB ADP DET NOUN VERB VERB DET ADJ ADV ADV ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN CCONJ ADP DET NOUN ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN VERB ADV VERB VERB PUNCT ADP NOUN PROPN VERB NOUN CCONJ VERB ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP VERB PRON ADP DET NOUN NOUN ADP NOUN CCONJ ADV PART VERB PART NOUN CCONJ ADV DET ADJ NOUN VERB VERB ADP ADJ NOUN PRON ADV VERB DET NOUN ADP ADJ PRON VERB VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN CCONJ VERB VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADJ VERB ADP DET NOUN PROPN VERB PRON ADP NOUN
