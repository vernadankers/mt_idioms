If that power was sufficient, the holy spirit, if that power was sufficient to raise Christ from the dead, you not think he's able to exert that power in your life and in my life to make us live lives that are pleasing to God, of course it is so we don't do it ourselves, just let me in closing mention one other thing, this relationship we have needs to be maintained, you know for any relationship to grow, one needs to spend time with the other person, I don't give a lot of credence to the saying that absence makes the heart grow fonder, it does with somebody else, it's true, it does not make it grow fonder of that person the person is you know who you, you heard this story so often, like particularly like going back during the last war, folk who were separated sometimes for, for, not just for months but for several years, there they were in concentration camps perhaps, in prisoner of war camps, separated for years, they come back home they 've got to get to know each other all over again you see that a relationship on a human level as well as in our relationship with God is dependent on, on association, it's dependent on companionship, it's dependent on spending time with the other person and in our relationship with Christ this is achieved by, by prayer, by knowing and understanding God's word, by having fellowship with other Christians and fellowship with other Christians is not just meeting them and passing the time of day with them, oh that's fellowship but it's far more than that is required, there's the fellowship in worship, we worship together, of course I can worship God at home of course I can do it, so can you do it and we, we should do it, but there's that re, there's that need, that requirement as God's people we come together to worship him in a corporate act, in the sacraments, in, as we mentioned in, in earlier on in taking the bread and the wine and remembering the lords death, there's a sense in which I can do it by myself	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	pass the time of day	figurative	inflection	ADP DET NOUN VERB ADJ DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN VERB ADJ PART VERB PROPN ADP DET ADJ PRON ADV VERB PRON ADJ PART VERB DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN CCONJ ADP ADJ NOUN PART VERB PRON VERB NOUN ADJ VERB ADJ ADP PROPN ADP NOUN PRON VERB ADV PRON VERB VERB PRON PRON ADV VERB PRON ADP VERB VERB NUM ADJ NOUN DET NOUN PRON VERB NOUN PART VERB VERB PRON VERB ADP DET NOUN PART VERB PRON VERB PART VERB NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PRON VERB VERB DET NOUN ADP NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN VERB DET NOUN VERB NOUN PRON VERB ADP NOUN ADV PRON ADJ PRON VERB ADV VERB PRON VERB NOUN ADP DET NOUN DET NOUN VERB PRON VERB NOUN PRON PRON VERB DET NOUN ADV ADV INTJ ADV INTJ VERB ADV ADP DET ADJ NOUN NOUN NOUN VERB VERB ADV ADP ADP ADV ADV ADP NOUN CCONJ ADP ADJ NOUN ADV PRON VERB ADP NOUN NOUN ADV ADP NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN VERB ADP NOUN PRON VERB ADV ADV PRON VERB VERB PART VERB PART VERB DET ADJ ADV ADV ADV PRON VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADV ADV ADP ADP ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN VERB ADJ ADP ADP NOUN PRON ADJ ADP NOUN PRON ADJ ADP VERB NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN CCONJ ADP ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN DET VERB VERB ADV ADP NOUN ADP VERB CCONJ VERB PROPN NOUN ADP VERB NOUN ADP ADJ PROPN CCONJ NOUN ADP ADJ PROPN VERB ADV ADV VERB PRON CCONJ VERB DET NOUN ADP NOUN ADP PRON INTJ DET NOUN CCONJ PRON ADV ADJ ADP DET VERB VERB ADV DET NOUN ADP NOUN PRON VERB ADV ADP NOUN PRON VERB VERB PROPN ADP NOUN ADP NOUN PRON VERB VERB PRON ADV VERB PRON VERB PRON CCONJ PRON PRON VERB VERB PRON CCONJ ADV DET NOUN ADV DET NOUN DET NOUN ADP PROPN NOUN PRON VERB ADV PART VERB PRON ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADV ADP PRON VERB ADV ADP ADV ADV ADP VERB DET NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN CCONJ VERB DET NOUN NOUN ADV DET NOUN ADP ADJ PRON VERB VERB PRON ADP PRON
