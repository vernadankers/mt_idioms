Part of the explanation for this is that government spending tends to be planned over a number of years ( e.g. hospitals, schools, and other capital expenditures take several years to complete, and governments are reluctant to dismiss teachers, policemen, and other employees for short - term economic reasons ) ; consequently such expenditure tends to be fairly inflexible, especially downwards, in the short run.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1	in the short run	figurative	identical	NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET VERB ADP NOUN NOUN VERB PART VERB VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT ADJ NOUN NOUN CCONJ ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB ADJ NOUN PART VERB CCONJ NOUN VERB ADJ PART VERB NOUN NOUN CCONJ ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ PUNCT NOUN ADJ NOUN PUNCT PUNCT ADV ADJ NOUN VERB PART VERB ADV ADJ ADV ADV ADP DET ADJ NOUN
