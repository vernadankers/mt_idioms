on the road to Damascus and saved him, but he did, it was a tremendous surprise to the Apostle Paul that the Lord had saved him at all, he never got over it, he called himself the chief of sinners, but God's grace, God's mercy had been revealed to him, you and I when we get to heaven are in for a few surprises, the grace, the mercy of God is far broader and wider than our imagination, we 'll meet a lot of folk there that we didn't expect to see that leads me to a fourth proposition, not only will some be saved that we did not expect to be saved, but it's clear that others will not be saved who expected to be saved there's a passage in Luke thirteen, verses twenty five, let me read them again one the head of the house gets up and shuts the door you begin to stand outside and knock on the door saying Lord open up to us and then he will answer and say to you I do not know where you 're from, then you 'll begin to say we ate and drank in your presence, you taught in our streets, we know you Lord, we rubbed shoulders with you, we went to church, we experience those things, we knew the answers to the re to the questions but he will say I tell you I did not know where you are from, depart from me all you evil doers those words make it quite clear, here, there's words of Jesus, there's references to those who profess, to know the Lord Jesus Christ, but who do not in fact know him at all, they know bits and pieces about him, they 've seen him, you know it's in its immediate context, they had seen him in the street, they had heard his teaching, there maybe those who had been fed by the, by the miraculous er multiplying of the loafs and the fishes, they had seen the miracle, some of them may have been healed by Jesus, they knew lots about him but they did not know him and he says I do not know you how many folk there are like this, they expect to be saved, perhaps because they go to church, perhaps because they 've got Christian parents, perhaps because they read their bible, perhaps because occasionally when they 're in trouble they prayer, they 've been confirmed, they 've been baptized, that, that they 're good, they 're honest, they 're not rogues, they wouldn't do a, a, a bad turn to somebody, not deliberately, they 're nice people but they, they don't know the truth of what it says in God's word, they don't know the truth of Romans three and verse twenty because by the works of the Lord no flesh will be justified in his sight for through the law comes the knowledge of sin, doesn't come the forgiveness of it, they don't know the truth of Ephesians chapter two verses eight and nine for by grace you 've been saved through faith and that not of yourselves it's the gift of God, not as a result of works that no one should boast, for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus for good works which God prepared before hand that we should walk in them, they don't know the truth of er, er of Titus, chapter three and, and verse five where, where the apostle Paul says there, he saved us not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to his mercy, how tragic it is to expect to be saved, to think you 're going to heaven and in the end to find that you 're not saved and Jesus says they 'll be many like that in that day.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
