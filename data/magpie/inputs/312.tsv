And what happens is that if an embryo has the single gene for being male, it happens to have a white chromosome not surprisingly, it turns on thousands of other genes that then make the embryo into a male, but, but that single gene has to be there to act as a switch and that's that gene is also present in alligators and crocodiles so the point I 'm making is it is just wrong to say that, that all these discoveries about genetics cut no ice with human evolution, because human things can not be influenced by single genes.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	cut no ice	figurative	identical	CCONJ NOUN VERB VERB ADP ADP DET NOUN VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP VERB ADJ PRON VERB PART VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADV ADV PRON VERB ADP NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN ADJ ADV VERB DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN CCONJ CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN VERB PART VERB ADV PART VERB ADP DET NOUN CCONJ DET DET NOUN VERB ADV ADJ ADP NOUN CCONJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PRON NOUN VERB VERB PRON VERB ADV ADJ PART VERB ADP ADP ADJ DET NOUN ADP NOUN VERB DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN VERB ADV VERB VERB ADP ADJ NOUN	▁And ▁what ▁happens ▁is ▁that ▁if ▁an ▁embryo ▁has ▁the ▁single ▁gene ▁for ▁being ▁male , ▁it ▁happens ▁to ▁have ▁a ▁white ▁chromosome ▁not ▁surprising ly , ▁it ▁turns ▁on ▁thousands ▁of ▁other ▁gene s ▁that ▁then ▁make ▁the ▁embryo ▁into ▁a ▁male , ▁but , ▁but ▁that ▁single ▁gene ▁has ▁to ▁be ▁there ▁to ▁act ▁as ▁a ▁switch ▁and ▁that ' s ▁that ▁gene ▁is ▁also ▁present ▁in ▁all ig ators ▁and ▁crocodile s ▁so ▁the ▁point ▁I ▁' m ▁making ▁is ▁it ▁is ▁just ▁wrong ▁to ▁say ▁that , ▁that ▁all ▁these ▁discover ies ▁about ▁genetic s ▁cut ▁no ▁ice ▁with ▁human ▁evolution , ▁because ▁human ▁things ▁can ▁not ▁be ▁influenced ▁by ▁single ▁gene s .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	CCONJ NOUN VERB VERB ADP ADP DET NOUN VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP VERB ADJ ADJ PRON VERB PART VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADV ADV ADV ADV PRON VERB ADP NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN ADJ ADV VERB DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN CCONJ CCONJ CCONJ DET ADJ NOUN VERB PART VERB ADV PART VERB ADP DET NOUN CCONJ DET DET DET DET NOUN VERB ADV ADJ ADP NOUN NOUN NOUN CCONJ NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN PRON NOUN NOUN VERB VERB PRON VERB ADV ADJ PART VERB ADP ADP ADP ADJ DET NOUN NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN VERB DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN VERB ADV VERB VERB ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN NOUN
