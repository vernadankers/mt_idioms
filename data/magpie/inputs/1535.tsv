Commenting on another storming quarter — figures, page seven — Microsoft Corp, whose third quarter earnings of $ 0.80 a share were above consensus analyst estimates of $ 0.78 for the period, warned that fourth quarter growth in profits would be less impressive —‘One of the things that's different in this fourth quarter is we don't have this kicker product, the icing on the cake,’ said Microsoft investor relations chief Raymond Ferguson ; Microsoft said it shipped a record - breaking 2 m MS - DOS 6 retail upgrade copies in the two weeks since it hit the market, but the company said they would be pleased if fourth - quarter revenues rose by half the roughly 20 % sequential quarterly rate of recent years, when Microsoft has benefited from upgrade versions of Windows 3.0, MS - DOS 5 and then Windows 3.1 ; it is still likely to see its first billion dollar quarter this time ; during the fiscal third quarter, sales of applications, which accounted for 61 % of total revenues in the period, leaped 63 % over year - ago levels to $ 580 m, and Microsoft ended the quarter with $ 2,000 m in cash ; shipment of Windows NT is on schedule for late June following a late May unveiling, the firm said.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	the icing on the cake	figurative	deletion-determiner	VERB ADP DET VERB NOUN PUNCT NOUN NOUN NUM PUNCT PROPN PROPN ADJ ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP SYM NUM DET NOUN VERB ADP NOUN NOUN NOUN ADP SYM NUM ADP DET NOUN VERB ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP NOUN VERB VERB ADV ADJ NUM ADP DET NOUN ADJ ADJ ADP DET ADJ NOUN VERB PRON VERB VERB DET NOUN NOUN DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN VERB PROPN NOUN NOUN NOUN PROPN PROPN PUNCT PROPN VERB PRON VERB DET NOUN PUNCT VERB NUM NOUN PROPN PUNCT PROPN NUM ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP DET NUM NOUN ADP PRON VERB DET NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN VERB PRON VERB VERB ADJ ADP ADJ PUNCT NOUN NOUN VERB ADP ADJ DET ADV NUM NOUN ADJ ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN ADV PROPN VERB VERB ADP NOUN NOUN ADP PROPN NUM PROPN PUNCT PROPN NUM CCONJ ADV PROPN NUM PUNCT PRON VERB ADV ADJ PART VERB ADJ ADJ NUM NOUN NOUN DET NOUN PUNCT ADP DET ADJ ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP NOUN ADJ VERB ADP NUM NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN VERB NUM NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT ADJ NOUN ADP SYM NUM NOUN CCONJ PROPN VERB DET NOUN ADP SYM NUM NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT NOUN ADP PROPN PROPN VERB ADP NOUN ADP ADJ PROPN VERB DET ADJ PROPN NOUN DET NOUN VERB	▁Com ment ing ▁on ▁another ▁storm ing ▁quarter ▁ — ▁figures , ▁page ▁seven ▁ — ▁Microsoft ▁Corp , ▁whose ▁third ▁quarter ▁earnings ▁of ▁$ ▁0.8 0 ▁a ▁share ▁were ▁above ▁consensus ▁analyst ▁estimates ▁of ▁$ ▁0.7 8 ▁for ▁the ▁period , ▁warned ▁that ▁fourth ▁quarter ▁growth ▁in ▁profits ▁would ▁be ▁less ▁impressive ▁ —‘ O ne ▁of ▁the ▁things ▁that ' s ▁different ▁in ▁this ▁fourth ▁quarter ▁is ▁we ▁don ' t ▁have ▁this ▁kick er ▁product , ▁the ▁ ic ing ▁on ▁the ▁cake , ’ ▁said ▁Microsoft ▁investor ▁relations ▁chief ▁Ray mond ▁Fergus on ▁ ;
