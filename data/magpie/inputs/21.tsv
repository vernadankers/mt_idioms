Er what I have chosen to do is to do what we were doing in the nineteen eighties, which is to take the simplest measure of the maximum flow and the detrusor pressure at that volume and when we do that, you can see that these patients, instead of being a single group of patients with a single kind of bladder pressure and flow, these patients are all over the map.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1	all over the map	figurative	identical	INTJ NOUN PRON VERB VERB PART VERB VERB PART VERB NOUN PRON VERB VERB ADP DET NUM NOUN ADJ VERB PART VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN CCONJ ADV PRON VERB DET PRON VERB VERB ADP DET NOUN ADV ADP VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN CCONJ NOUN DET NOUN VERB ADV ADP DET NOUN	▁Er ▁what ▁I ▁have ▁chosen ▁to ▁do ▁is ▁to ▁do ▁what ▁we ▁were ▁doing ▁in ▁the ▁nine te en ▁eight ies , ▁which ▁is ▁to ▁take ▁the ▁simple st ▁measure ▁of ▁the ▁maximum ▁flow ▁and ▁the ▁de tru s or ▁pressure ▁at ▁that ▁volume ▁and ▁when ▁we ▁do ▁that , ▁you ▁can ▁see ▁that ▁these ▁patients , ▁instead ▁of ▁being ▁a ▁single ▁group ▁of ▁patients ▁with ▁a ▁single ▁kind ▁of ▁bladder ▁pressure ▁and ▁flow , ▁these ▁patients ▁are ▁all ▁over ▁the ▁map .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1	INTJ NOUN PRON VERB VERB PART VERB VERB PART VERB NOUN PRON VERB VERB ADP DET NUM NUM NUM NOUN NOUN NOUN ADJ VERB PART VERB DET ADJ ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN CCONJ ADV PRON VERB DET DET PRON VERB VERB ADP DET NOUN NOUN ADV ADP VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN CCONJ NOUN NOUN DET NOUN VERB ADV ADP DET NOUN NOUN
