On the Thursday morning early I set off to go to Peter Jones before my meeting in Markham Square and I put your birthday money ( for which my thanks ) towards a tiny little black leather bag about the size of the one I came south with, as it fits under my jacket without looking too bulky and my old similar one, also from the John Lewis partnership some years ago, recently gave up the ghost after three years of relentless daily use.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	give up the ghost	figurative	inflection	ADP DET PROPN NOUN ADV PRON VERB PART PART VERB ADP PROPN PROPN ADP ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN PROPN CCONJ PRON VERB ADJ NOUN NOUN PUNCT ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADP DET ADJ ADJ ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN PRON VERB ADV ADP ADP PRON VERB ADP ADJ NOUN ADP VERB ADV ADJ CCONJ ADJ ADJ ADJ NOUN ADV ADP DET PROPN PROPN NOUN DET NOUN ADV ADV VERB PART DET NOUN ADP NUM NOUN ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN	▁On ▁the ▁Thursday ▁morning ▁early ▁I ▁set ▁off ▁to ▁go ▁to ▁Peter ▁Jones ▁before ▁my ▁meeting ▁in ▁Mark ham ▁Square ▁and ▁I ▁put ▁your ▁birth day ▁money ▁( ▁for ▁which ▁my ▁thanks ▁ ) ▁towards ▁a ▁tiny ▁little ▁black ▁leather ▁bag ▁about ▁the ▁size ▁of ▁the ▁one ▁I ▁came ▁south ▁with , ▁as ▁it ▁fits ▁under ▁my ▁ jacket ▁without ▁looking ▁too ▁bulk y ▁and ▁my ▁old ▁similar ▁one , ▁also ▁from ▁the ▁John ▁Le wi s ▁partnership ▁some ▁years ▁ago , ▁recently ▁gave ▁up ▁the ▁g host ▁after ▁three ▁years ▁of ▁re lent less ▁daily ▁use .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	ADP DET PROPN NOUN ADV PRON VERB PART PART VERB ADP PROPN PROPN ADP ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN PROPN PROPN CCONJ PRON VERB ADJ NOUN NOUN NOUN PUNCT ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT PUNCT ADP DET ADJ ADJ ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN PRON VERB ADV ADP ADP ADP PRON VERB ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP VERB ADV ADJ ADJ CCONJ ADJ ADJ ADJ NOUN NOUN ADV ADP DET PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN NOUN DET NOUN ADV ADV ADV VERB PART DET NOUN NOUN ADP NUM NOUN ADP ADJ ADJ ADJ ADJ NOUN NOUN

At the same time, d the Tories are on their knees, some people, as I said earlier, I think it's just as relevant in this debate, seem to have lost their way and when you took, look at what they 're proposing in terms of say, the er the fifty percent, the, the er M Ps, fifty percent of the votes for er the Parliamentary leader which of course is very consistent with, right, fifty percent of the vote, you take that along with proportional representation and what I believe you 're seeing is the number of people who have given up the ghost and are preparing to restructure the Party around coalition politics, and that's where they 're heading, and they 're heading completely in the wrong direction because we 're more in tune with what's going on in this country, the po opinion polls are saying fifty nine percent of the people actually I think, believe that er the Labour government is possible and will be voting for a Labour government, the alternative road is to oblivion and it's not about modernizing, the people who 're proposing this coalition politics aren't modernizers, they 're Victorian politics, that's what they 're about, they 're about taking us back, back before we created the Party, before we learnt the lesson that we needed to represent ourselves politically, they 're going back to, let's skil see what we get out of the Liberals, the free trade Liberals, in the nineteenth century, that's where they 're going back, that's not about modernization, real modernization is about making sure that the Labour Party speaks for the working people up and down this country and that's our contribution to make to that Party and therefore we should have a role in decision making and influencing the Party that enables us as an organization to express that feeling, and that understanding of what people actually want in this country, and that's why we 're supporting the C E C proposals.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
