Similarly, the explosion in the population of sentenced prisoners, which was an ongoing phenomenon for most of the 1990s, appears to be largely attributable to the persistent practice of ‘ over - sentencing’— both in the sense of using custody unnecessarily for minor property offenders and others, and of imposing longer sentences across the board than is required for strictly reductivist purposes — for which responsibility rests mainly, but not exclusively, with the Crown Court.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	across the board	figurative	identical	ADV DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP VERB NOUN ADJ VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ ADP DET NOUN VERB PART VERB ADV ADJ ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP PUNCT ADP PUNCT NOUN CCONJ ADP DET NOUN ADP VERB NOUN ADV ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN CCONJ NOUN CCONJ ADP VERB ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP VERB VERB ADP ADV ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADP ADJ NOUN VERB ADV CCONJ ADV ADV ADP DET PROPN PROPN	▁Similarly , ▁the ▁explosion ▁in ▁the ▁population ▁of ▁sentenced ▁prisoners , ▁which ▁was ▁an ▁ongoing ▁phenomenon ▁for ▁most ▁of ▁the ▁1990 s , ▁appears ▁to ▁be ▁largely ▁attributable ▁to ▁the ▁persistent ▁practice ▁of ▁ ‘ ▁over ▁- ▁sent encing ’— ▁both ▁in ▁the ▁sense ▁of ▁using ▁custody ▁unnecessarily ▁for ▁minor ▁property ▁of fender s ▁and ▁others , ▁and ▁of ▁imposing ▁longer ▁sentences ▁across ▁the ▁board ▁than ▁is ▁required ▁for ▁strictly ▁reduct iv ist ▁purposes ▁ — ▁for ▁which ▁responsibility ▁rests ▁mainly , ▁but ▁not ▁exclusively , ▁with ▁the ▁Crown ▁Court .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	ADV ADV DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP VERB NOUN NOUN ADJ VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ ADP DET NOUN NOUN NOUN VERB PART VERB ADV ADJ ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP PUNCT PUNCT ADP PUNCT NOUN NOUN NOUN CCONJ ADP DET NOUN ADP VERB NOUN ADV ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN CCONJ NOUN NOUN CCONJ ADP VERB ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP VERB VERB ADP ADV ADJ ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT PUNCT ADP ADJ NOUN VERB ADV ADV CCONJ ADV ADV ADV ADP DET PROPN PROPN PROPN

Nao Naomi realizes there's no point talking about it now, the dye has been cast the decision has been made, the commitment has been entered into, whatever the cost she was going gods way, there was nothing more to be said about it we find that a de a decision made before god and we all make those decisions, means nothing at all unless were determined to carry it through, whatever the cost may be, three women here make their decisions before god, they make their choices, Naomi she chooses to return to Judah once again and enjoy the inheritance god has given her, Auper she chooses to return to her own country and her own god, as far as were concerned that's the end of the story, but Ruth she chooses, she expresses her faith in the one true god, she turns her back on the old ways and decides to follow gods way, no matter what the cost, she would of said with Joshua, but as for me and my husband were gon na serve god, whatever the cost, I dunno what 'll be and she didn't know what she was letting herself in for, and the, I counted it, although I don't know what it is, I counted that cost, I 'm willing to pay it and Jesus said that that is the acid test of disciples, said to count the cost and weigh it up and Ruth had done that, then to make their decision and because if we make a decision without counting the cost, without weighing it all up, like Auper you 'll go back, it won't last, there is that choice for every one of us day by day, who will we serve, not to be like Joshua, its for us, never for any body else, I will serve the lord because and this is the reason for it, not because you 've done nice things for me, I will be your saviour because he is god, that's the reason for our serving god, not because he blesses us because he blesses people who don't serve him, blessing is not exclusive to gods people, blessing, god blesses across the board, god is generous he's gracious, he causes the rain and the sun to shine on the just and on the unjust, blessing is not the ground for serving god, but because he is god that's sufficient reason for our committing ourselves to him.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
