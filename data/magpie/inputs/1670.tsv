I 've not had the experience perhaps of teaching so many dyslexic children to be able to comment on this, but certainly when I was making the videotape at Brickwall School and I asked the headmaster about that and he pointed to the fact that they certainly have a very wide intake, a complete social mix, and Professor Miles at Bangor University says that in his experience of dealing with dyslexic children they come from all walks of life, and it's really quite inaccurate — I suppose there's a sense in which, if we 've got to use these phrases, that middle class people have always been very concerned about the education of their children and so they may be the parents who will ask questions about their children's lack of development, but I think it's only, you know, more significant in middle class terms because of that.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	walk of life	figurative	inflection	PRON VERB ADV VERB DET NOUN ADV ADP VERB ADV ADJ ADJ NOUN PART VERB ADJ PART VERB ADP DET CCONJ ADV ADV PRON VERB VERB DET NOUN ADP PROPN PROPN CCONJ PRON VERB DET NOUN ADP DET CCONJ PRON VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP PRON ADV VERB DET ADV ADJ NOUN DET ADJ ADJ NOUN CCONJ PROPN PROPN ADP PROPN PROPN VERB ADP ADP ADJ NOUN ADP VERB ADP ADJ NOUN PRON VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN CCONJ PRON ADV ADV ADJ PUNCT PRON VERB ADV DET NOUN ADP ADJ ADP PRON VERB VERB PART VERB DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB ADV VERB ADV ADJ ADP DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN CCONJ ADV PRON VERB VERB DET NOUN NOUN VERB VERB NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP NOUN CCONJ PRON VERB PRON ADV PRON VERB ADV ADJ ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP ADP DET	▁I ▁' ve ▁not ▁had ▁the ▁experience ▁perhaps ▁of ▁teaching ▁so ▁many ▁dys lex ic ▁children ▁to ▁be ▁able ▁to ▁comment ▁on ▁this , ▁but ▁certainly ▁when ▁I ▁was ▁making ▁the ▁video tape ▁at ▁B rick wall ▁School ▁and ▁I ▁asked ▁the ▁head master ▁about ▁that ▁and ▁he ▁pointed ▁to ▁the ▁fact ▁that ▁they ▁certainly ▁have ▁a ▁very ▁wide ▁intake , ▁a ▁complete ▁social ▁mix , ▁and ▁Professor ▁Mil es ▁at ▁B ang or ▁University ▁says ▁that ▁in ▁his ▁experience ▁of ▁dealing ▁with ▁dys lex ic ▁children ▁they ▁come ▁from ▁all ▁walk s ▁of ▁life , ▁and ▁it ' s ▁really ▁quite ▁inaccurate ▁ — ▁I ▁suppose ▁there ' s ▁a ▁sense ▁in ▁which , ▁if ▁we ▁' ve ▁got ▁to ▁use ▁these ▁phrases , ▁that ▁middle ▁class ▁people ▁have ▁always ▁been ▁very ▁concerned ▁about ▁the ▁education ▁of ▁their ▁children ▁and ▁so ▁they ▁may ▁be ▁the ▁parents ▁who ▁will ▁ask ▁questions ▁about ▁their ▁children ' s ▁lack ▁of ▁development , ▁but ▁I ▁think ▁it ' s ▁only , ▁you ▁know , ▁more ▁significant ▁in ▁middle ▁class ▁terms ▁because ▁of ▁that .	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	PRON VERB VERB ADV VERB DET NOUN ADV ADP VERB ADV ADJ ADJ ADJ ADJ NOUN PART VERB ADJ PART VERB ADP DET DET CCONJ ADV ADV PRON VERB VERB DET NOUN NOUN ADP PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN CCONJ PRON VERB DET NOUN NOUN ADP DET CCONJ PRON VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP PRON ADV VERB DET ADV ADJ NOUN NOUN DET ADJ ADJ NOUN NOUN CCONJ PROPN PROPN PROPN ADP PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN VERB ADP ADP ADJ NOUN ADP VERB ADP ADJ ADJ ADJ NOUN PRON VERB ADP DET NOUN NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN CCONJ PRON PRON PRON ADV ADV ADJ PUNCT PUNCT PRON VERB ADV ADV ADV DET NOUN ADP ADJ ADJ ADP PRON VERB VERB VERB PART VERB DET NOUN NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB ADV VERB ADV ADJ ADP DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN CCONJ ADV PRON VERB VERB DET NOUN NOUN VERB VERB NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN CCONJ PRON VERB PRON PRON PRON ADV ADV PRON VERB VERB ADV ADJ ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP ADP DET DET
