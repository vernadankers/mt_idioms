ONE OF the doughty pack leaders to emerge in the late 1940's from the Manchester scrum of ‘ palaeomagnetists’ was S, Keith Runcorn — a former Cambridge engineer with an almost unhealthy liking for the rough and tumble of the rugby field, Keith Runcorn is now professor of physics, and geophysics supremo, at the University of Newcastle - upon - Tyne — and incidentally the president of the university's rugby club, To honour Runcorn's reaching the age of 60, the university organised earlier this month a three - day conference on ‘ Magnetism, planetary rotation and convection in the Solar System’, Since the Second World War, geology has undergone conceptual upheavals as never before, The apparently ludicrous ideas proposed by Alfred Wegener in the 1920s, that the Earth's continents were drifting around, have found solid ground, The evidence came from physicists inspired by wartime work on radar, by cosmic - ray research and the discovery that some rotating stars have a magnetic field, The physicists set themselves the task of measuring whether rotating bodies on Earth also produce magnetic fields, The eminent Patrick Maynard Blackett devised a highly sensitive magnetometer for this work, but finding that a spinning gold cylinder produced no magnetic field, turned his machine to measuring rock magnetism, A school of expertise concerned with ‘ fossilised magnetism’developed around him at Manchester and later at Imperial College, London, The fruits of such work inspired a reappraisal of continental drift and new theories to explain the mechanisms responsible for moving the continents, and later produced the foundations on which were forged the unifying concepts of plate tectonics and seafloor spreading, Runcorn applies an enormous enthusiasm to all that he takes on — as many past students and editors of various science journals can testify, His first notoriety came with his attempts to determine whether the Earth's general magnetic field was related to the planet's rotation, or related to some deep - seated phenomenon, To determine this he took his magnetometer down some of the deep Lancashire coal pits.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	rough and tumble	figurative	identical	NUM ADP DET ADJ NOUN NOUN PART VERB ADP DET ADJ NUM ADP DET PROPN NOUN ADP PUNCT NOUN VERB PROPN PROPN PROPN PUNCT DET ADJ PROPN NOUN ADP DET ADV ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ CCONJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN PROPN PROPN VERB ADV NOUN ADP NOUN CCONJ VERB NOUN ADP DET PROPN ADP PROPN PUNCT ADP PUNCT PROPN PUNCT CCONJ ADV DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN NOUN PART VERB PROPN VERB DET NOUN ADP NUM DET NOUN VERB ADV DET NOUN DET NUM PUNCT NOUN NOUN ADP PUNCT NOUN ADJ NOUN CCONJ NOUN ADP DET PROPN PROPN ADP DET PROPN PROPN PROPN NOUN VERB VERB ADJ NOUN ADP ADV ADV DET ADV ADJ NOUN VERB ADP PROPN PROPN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET PROPN NOUN VERB VERB ADV VERB VERB ADJ NOUN DET NOUN VERB ADP NOUN VERB ADP ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN ADP ADJ PUNCT NOUN NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN ADJ DET VERB NOUN VERB DET ADJ NOUN DET NOUN VERB PRON DET NOUN ADP VERB ADP VERB NOUN ADP PROPN ADV VERB ADJ NOUN DET ADJ PROPN PROPN PROPN VERB DET ADV ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN CCONJ VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB DET ADJ NOUN VERB ADJ NOUN ADP VERB NOUN NOUN DET NOUN ADP NOUN VERB ADP PUNCT VERB VERB ADP PRON ADP PROPN CCONJ ADV ADP PROPN PROPN PROPN DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN VERB DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN CCONJ ADJ NOUN PART VERB DET NOUN ADJ ADP VERB DET NOUN CCONJ ADV VERB DET NOUN ADP ADJ VERB VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN CCONJ NOUN VERB PROPN VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ PRON VERB PART PUNCT ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN CCONJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB VERB ADJ ADJ NOUN VERB ADP ADJ NOUN PART VERB ADP DET PROPN ADJ ADJ NOUN VERB VERB ADP DET NOUN NOUN CCONJ VERB ADP DET ADV PUNCT ADJ NOUN PART VERB DET PRON VERB ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADP DET ADJ PROPN NOUN NOUN
