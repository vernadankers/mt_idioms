ONE OF the doughty pack leaders to emerge in the late 1940's from the Manchester scrum of ‘ palaeomagnetists’ was S, Keith Runcorn — a former Cambridge engineer with an almost unhealthy liking for the rough and tumble of the rugby field, Keith Runcorn is now professor of physics, and geophysics supremo, at the University of Newcastle - upon - Tyne — and incidentally the president of the university's rugby club, To honour Runcorn's reaching the age of 60, the university organised earlier this month a three - day conference on ‘ Magnetism, planetary rotation and convection in the Solar System’, Since the Second World War, geology has undergone conceptual upheavals as never before, The apparently ludicrous ideas proposed by Alfred Wegener in the 1920s, that the Earth's continents were drifting around, have found solid ground, The evidence came from physicists inspired by wartime work on radar, by cosmic - ray research and the discovery that some rotating stars have a magnetic field, The physicists set themselves the task of measuring whether rotating bodies on Earth also produce magnetic fields, The eminent Patrick Maynard Blackett devised a highly sensitive magnetometer for this work, but finding that a spinning gold cylinder produced no magnetic field, turned his machine to measuring rock magnetism, A school of expertise concerned with ‘ fossilised magnetism’developed around him at Manchester and later at Imperial College, London, The fruits of such work inspired a reappraisal of continental drift and new theories to explain the mechanisms responsible for moving the continents, and later produced the foundations on which were forged the unifying concepts of plate tectonics and seafloor spreading, Runcorn applies an enormous enthusiasm to all that he takes on — as many past students and editors of various science journals can testify, His first notoriety came with his attempts to determine whether the Earth's general magnetic field was related to the planet's rotation, or related to some deep - seated phenomenon, To determine this he took his magnetometer down some of the deep Lancashire coal pits.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
