After seeing Mr Stephens disappear around the corner, she examined the small room minutely, the books on the shelf — reading out all their titles aloud — the three prints on the wall, " The Education of the Young Raleigh ", " Derwentwater at Dawn " and " The Drunkard's Children " — drew her boots appreciatively over the mat, picked up the jug of pencils and finally came to the oven which was next to the sink.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	on the shelf	literal	identical	ADP VERB PROPN PROPN VERB ADP DET NOUN PRON VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADV DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT VERB PART DET ADJ NOUN ADV PUNCT DET NUM NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT DET PROPN ADP DET PROPN PROPN PUNCT PUNCT PROPN ADP PROPN PUNCT CCONJ PUNCT DET PROPN PROPN PUNCT PUNCT VERB ADJ NOUN ADV ADP DET NOUN VERB PART DET NOUN ADP NOUN CCONJ ADV VERB ADP DET NOUN ADJ VERB ADJ ADP DET NOUN
