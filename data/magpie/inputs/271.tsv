Pilot David Moore from Gloucestershire was at the controls of the forty seven year old Spitfire as it took part in an air display near Manchester on Saturday. The fighter plane looped the loop but as it neared the ground it plummeted down, bursting into flames. Firefighters were on the scene immediately, and confirmed that the pilot was dead. David Moore, who was 47, flew with the Royal Navy for ten years before joining Rolls Royce as a pilot in the mid 1970s. He flew the company's executives around Europe … but in his spare time he enjoyed piloting vintage planes like the Spitfire, which was owned by Rolls Royce. Today at the family's home near Stroud, David Moore's widow was coming to terms with the tragedy :	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0	come to terms with	figurative	inflection	NOUN PROPN PROPN ADP PROPN VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NUM NUM NOUN ADJ PROPN ADP PRON VERB NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN ADP PROPN ADP PROPN DET NOUN NOUN VERB DET NOUN CCONJ ADP PRON VERB DET NOUN PRON VERB PART VERB ADP NOUN NOUN VERB ADP DET NOUN ADV CCONJ VERB ADP DET NOUN VERB ADJ PROPN PROPN NOUN VERB NUM VERB ADP DET PROPN PROPN ADP NUM NOUN ADP VERB PROPN PROPN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PRON VERB DET NOUN NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT CCONJ ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN PRON VERB VERB ADJ NOUN ADP DET PROPN ADJ VERB VERB ADP PROPN PROPN NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN ADP PROPN PROPN PROPN NOUN VERB VERB ADP NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT	▁Pilot ▁David ▁Moor e ▁from ▁G lo uc ester shire ▁was ▁at ▁the ▁controls ▁of ▁the ▁forty ▁seven ▁year ▁old ▁S pit fire ▁as ▁it ▁took ▁part ▁in ▁an ▁air ▁display ▁near ▁Manchester ▁on ▁Saturday . ▁The ▁fighter ▁plane ▁loop ed ▁the ▁loop ▁but ▁as ▁it ▁near ed ▁the ▁ground ▁it ▁plum met ed ▁down , ▁burst ing ▁into ▁flame s . ▁Fire f ight ers ▁were ▁on ▁the ▁scene ▁immediately , ▁and ▁confirmed ▁that ▁the ▁pilot ▁was ▁dead . ▁David ▁Moor e , ▁who ▁was ▁47 , ▁f lew ▁with ▁the ▁Royal ▁Na vy ▁for ▁ten ▁years ▁before ▁joining ▁Roll s ▁Roy ce ▁as ▁a ▁pilot ▁in ▁the ▁mid ▁1970 s . ▁He ▁f lew ▁the ▁company ' s ▁executive s ▁around ▁Europe ▁... ▁but ▁in ▁his ▁spare ▁time ▁he ▁enjoyed ▁pilot ing ▁v int age ▁planes ▁like ▁the ▁S pit fire , ▁which ▁was ▁owned ▁by ▁Roll s ▁Roy ce . ▁Today ▁at ▁the ▁family ' s ▁home ▁near ▁Str oud , ▁David ▁Moor e ' s ▁widow ▁was ▁coming ▁to ▁terms ▁with ▁the ▁tragedy ▁ :	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0	NOUN PROPN PROPN PROPN ADP PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NUM NUM NOUN ADJ PROPN PROPN PROPN ADP PRON VERB NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN ADP PROPN ADP PROPN PROPN DET NOUN NOUN VERB VERB DET NOUN CCONJ ADP PRON VERB VERB DET NOUN PRON VERB VERB VERB PART PART VERB VERB ADP NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN VERB ADP DET NOUN ADV ADV CCONJ VERB ADP DET NOUN VERB ADJ ADJ PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN NOUN VERB NUM NUM VERB VERB ADP DET PROPN PROPN PROPN ADP NUM NOUN ADP VERB PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN NOUN NOUN PRON VERB VERB DET NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN ADP PROPN PUNCT CCONJ ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN PRON VERB VERB VERB ADJ ADJ ADJ NOUN ADP DET PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN ADJ VERB VERB ADP PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN ADP PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN NOUN VERB VERB ADP NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PUNCT
