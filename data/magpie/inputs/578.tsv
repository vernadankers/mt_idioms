Only see one way in which we are like God is in having moral and spiritual capacities no other creature has moral and spiritual capacities, they do not of the potential to worship, they do not of a code er, er, of moral laws, they 're not governed by that, it's a case of, of the, might makes right, it's a case of the strongest the one that survives and the weakest goes to the wall you 've only got to look er at a litter of pups and the last one is the one that's pushed to the back every time isn't it, there's no moral law there, those pups and the, and the bitch doesn't er work out, that because that one is weaker it should be getting more, more nourishment, it should be cared for better, it doesn't work like that in any thing else, but God has placed within humanity a moral responsibility and his place within as a spiritual capacity, were more than just animals, were created in his image, so God created us, capable of knowing him and growing to be like him and in his original creation they 're in need of, the, the, the highlight of it was when he came down and communicated and talked with Adam and Eve there in the garden and shared his heart with them and there was this perfect commune between God the creator and man his creation, he never did it to any animal, he didn't go and talk to the trees and the plants perfect though they were, he never looked on any of the other creatures that he had made, wonderful though they may be, beautiful in their colouring, and go and talk with them, but he talks with Adam and he shares his heart with him his purpose is that Adam should communicate with him and walk with him and has fellowship with him, growing to be like him, but you see even though God created us like that, he didn't create us as puppets, it wasn't God up in heaven pulling the strings and Adam did that and Eve did this and that was how it were, God is not a puppeteer and he made as capable of choosing good and evil, he gave us moral choices, because he made us his moral beings and so we could choose to do this and not to do that, we could choose to, to do this and to leave the other undone.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
