The computer could be used to rescale the image pixel values so that the lowest value in the image ( 25 ) was interpolated onto the lowest value that the display system could accommodate ( 0 ) while the highest value in the raw image ( 90 ) was mapped to the maximum value that could be held at a pixel point in the image memory bank ( 255 ).	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	in the raw	literal	identical	DET NOUN VERB VERB VERB PART VERB DET NOUN NOUN NOUN ADP ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT NUM PUNCT VERB VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADJ DET NOUN NOUN VERB VERB PUNCT PUNCT PUNCT ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT NUM PUNCT VERB VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADJ VERB VERB VERB ADP DET NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN NOUN PUNCT NUM PUNCT

The clarification of water by means of sedimentation becomes more complex with the use of dosing methods and upward - flow tanks, but, with analytical checks on the treatment the results can be much more consistent than with the simpler settlement in mill lodges, and there need be no interruption in supply caused by variations in the raw water or the need for cleaning out tanks.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	in the raw	literal	identical	DET NOUN ADP NOUN ADP NOUN ADP NOUN VERB ADV ADJ ADP DET NOUN ADP VERB NOUN CCONJ ADJ PUNCT NOUN NOUN CCONJ ADP ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN DET NOUN VERB VERB ADV ADV ADJ ADP ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN NOUN CCONJ ADV VERB VERB DET NOUN ADP NOUN VERB ADP NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN ADP VERB PART NOUN
