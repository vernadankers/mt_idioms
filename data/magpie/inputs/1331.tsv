But lets just notice two or three things in this particular interview, the first thing that we see and its so obvious is that the way of salvation is so wondrously simple, it couldn't be easier, you know there are so many people who think it is hard to get saved, who think it is hard to come to Christ and to become a Christian, well the problem is you see the devil has blinded their eyes, they 've blinded the eyes of men and women, so that they think that they can't do this, but what is actually happened, Paul tells us in, in, in Carinthians in the first er, in to Carinthians in chapter four and verse four, he says the god of this world has blinded the eyes of the unbelieving that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of god, and there is this shroud, this covering, but the thing is god takes that away so that we can see and so its not difficult to become a Christian, it is not hard to get saved, sometimes as Christians we are guilty of making it difficult for people to become Christians, we put all sorts of rules in, we, we make them undergo various periods of er, of probation before we wer we 've were, were willing to call them Christians, remember the Philippine jailer he cried out there to the apostle Paul who was er in jail there with Silus the, the be, the tremendous earthquake and they were released all their vetoers was, were broken and the prisoners were all, could of escaped and the ja, the Philippine jailer he cries out a question that I 'm sure he doesn't even know what he means when he calls it out, he's not thinking of heaven, he's not thinking of the future life, he's not thinking of having his sins dealt with but he just cries out what must I do to be saved and the apostle Paul and he gets, opens the scrolls and he starts in genesis and he explains the plan of salvation and he tells him what he's got to do and he explains all the requirements and then about three or four hours later the mans mind is completely blurred he doesn't understand a word of it, its gone way beyond him	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	see the light	figurative	identical	CCONJ VERB ADV VERB NUM CCONJ NUM NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN DET ADJ NOUN ADJ PRON VERB CCONJ ADJ ADV ADJ VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN VERB ADV ADV ADJ PRON VERB VERB ADJ PRON VERB ADV VERB ADV ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB PRON VERB ADJ PART VERB VERB NOUN VERB PRON VERB ADJ PART VERB ADP PROPN CCONJ PART VERB DET PROPN INTJ DET NOUN VERB PRON VERB DET NOUN VERB VERB ADJ NOUN PRON VERB VERB DET NOUN ADP NOUN CCONJ NOUN ADP ADP PRON VERB ADP PRON VERB VERB DET CCONJ NOUN VERB ADV VERB PROPN VERB PRON PART ADV ADP PROPN ADP DET ADJ INTJ ADP ADP PROPN ADP NOUN NUM CCONJ NOUN NUM PRON VERB DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN VERB VERB DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP PRON VERB ADV VERB DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP PROPN NOUN VERB DET NOUN ADP NOUN CCONJ ADV VERB DET NOUN DET NOUN CCONJ DET NOUN VERB NOUN VERB DET ADV ADP ADP PRON VERB VERB CCONJ ADV ADJ ADV ADJ PART VERB DET PROPN PRON VERB ADV ADJ PART VERB VERB ADV ADP PROPN PRON VERB ADJ ADP VERB PRON ADJ ADP NOUN PART VERB PROPN PRON VERB DET NOUN ADP NOUN ADV PRON PRON VERB PRON VERB ADJ NOUN ADP INTJ ADP NOUN ADP PRON VERB PRON VERB VERB VERB ADJ PART VERB PRON PROPN VERB DET ADJ NOUN PRON VERB PART ADV ADP DET ADJ PROPN NOUN VERB INTJ ADP NOUN ADV ADP PROPN DET DET VERB DET ADJ NOUN CCONJ PRON VERB VERB DET ADJ NOUN VERB VERB VERB CCONJ DET NOUN VERB DET VERB ADP ADJ CCONJ DET PROPN DET ADJ NOUN PRON VERB PART DET NOUN ADP PRON VERB ADJ PRON VERB ADV VERB NOUN PRON VERB ADV PRON VERB PRON PART PRON ADV VERB ADP PROPN PRON ADV VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN PRON ADV VERB ADP VERB ADJ NOUN VERB ADP CCONJ PRON ADV VERB PART NOUN VERB PRON VERB PART VERB VERB CCONJ DET ADJ PROPN CCONJ PRON VERB VERB DET NOUN CCONJ PRON VERB ADP NOUN CCONJ PRON VERB DET NOUN ADP NOUN CCONJ PRON VERB PRON NOUN PRON VERB PART VERB CCONJ PRON VERB ADJ DET NOUN CCONJ ADV ADV NUM CCONJ NUM NOUN ADV DET NOUN NOUN VERB ADV VERB PRON VERB VERB DET NOUN ADP PRON ADJ VERB NOUN ADP PRON
