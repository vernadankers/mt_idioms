But lets just notice two or three things in this particular interview, the first thing that we see and its so obvious is that the way of salvation is so wondrously simple, it couldn't be easier, you know there are so many people who think it is hard to get saved, who think it is hard to come to Christ and to become a Christian, well the problem is you see the devil has blinded their eyes, they 've blinded the eyes of men and women, so that they think that they can't do this, but what is actually happened, Paul tells us in, in, in Carinthians in the first er, in to Carinthians in chapter four and verse four, he says the god of this world has blinded the eyes of the unbelieving that they might not see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of god, and there is this shroud, this covering, but the thing is god takes that away so that we can see and so its not difficult to become a Christian, it is not hard to get saved, sometimes as Christians we are guilty of making it difficult for people to become Christians, we put all sorts of rules in, we, we make them undergo various periods of er, of probation before we wer we 've were, were willing to call them Christians, remember the Philippine jailer he cried out there to the apostle Paul who was er in jail there with Silus the, the be, the tremendous earthquake and they were released all their vetoers was, were broken and the prisoners were all, could of escaped and the ja, the Philippine jailer he cries out a question that I 'm sure he doesn't even know what he means when he calls it out, he's not thinking of heaven, he's not thinking of the future life, he's not thinking of having his sins dealt with but he just cries out what must I do to be saved and the apostle Paul and he gets, opens the scrolls and he starts in genesis and he explains the plan of salvation and he tells him what he's got to do and he explains all the requirements and then about three or four hours later the mans mind is completely blurred he doesn't understand a word of it, its gone way beyond him	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
