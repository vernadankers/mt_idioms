The studio almost immediately cast her in a cycle of prestigious ( if often meretricious)‘women's pictures’, including Edmund Goulding's Dark Victory ( 1939 ), which had her, in its famous climactic scene, walk upstairs to die in solitude with all the dignified serenity of an elephant trundling off to its ancestral graveyard ; Michael Curtiz's The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex ( also 1939 ), in which she flaunted the Virgin Queen's ( and her own ) baldness as the ultimate emblem of great, self - abasing character acting ; and, of course, Irving Rapper's sudsy, multi - Kleenex tearjerker Now, Voyager ( 1942 ), in which her repressed, plain - Jane spinster blossoms overnight into chic, radiant, cigarette - tapping womanhood.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	plain jane	figurative	dashes	DET NOUN ADV ADV VERB PRON ADP DET NOUN ADP ADJ PUNCT ADP ADV NOUN NOUN VERB PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN PUNCT NUM PUNCT ADJ VERB PRON ADP ADJ ADJ ADJ NOUN VERB ADV PART VERB ADP NOUN ADP ADJ DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN VERB PART ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT PROPN PROPN DET ADJ NOUN ADP PROPN CCONJ PROPN PUNCT ADV NUM PUNCT ADP ADJ PRON VERB DET PROPN PROPN PUNCT CCONJ ADJ ADJ PUNCT NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT VERB NOUN VERB PUNCT CCONJ ADP NOUN PROPN PROPN NOUN ADJ PUNCT PROPN NOUN ADV PROPN PUNCT NUM PUNCT ADP ADJ ADJ VERB ADJ PUNCT PROPN NOUN NOUN ADV ADP ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT VERB NOUN
There are often, among the competitors, girls from Eastern Bloc or otherwise under - privileged countries who have been brought up to believe that a monumental talent requires total dedication, who have been told that great minds do not fuss about small externals, who have been led to suppose that for a great genius to be a plain Jane is only appropriate.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0	plain jane	figurative	identical	ADV VERB ADV ADP DET NOUN NOUN ADP PROPN PROPN CCONJ ADV ADV PUNCT ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB VERB VERB PART PART VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN VERB ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB VERB VERB ADP ADJ NOUN VERB ADV VERB ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB VERB VERB PART VERB DET ADP DET ADJ NOUN PART VERB DET ADJ PROPN VERB ADV ADJ
