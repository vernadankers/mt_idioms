William Shawcross who, along with many others, covered the Vietnam war for The Sunday Times and who subsequently became obsessed with the fate of Cambodia, an obsession that resulted first in Sideshow, which exposed the role of Nixon and Kissinger, and then in The Quality of Mercy, a study of the work of the Red Cross in Cambodia ; John Pilger, the British - based Australian journalist whose work on Cambodia may have had little concrete effect but has at least helped to ensure that the tragic country will never disappear into oblivion ;
