Rather there is an essential assumption of that basic face - to - face conversational context in which all humans acquire language, or as Lyons ( 1977a : 637 - 8 ) has put it rather more precisely : The grammaticalization and lexicalization of deixis is best understood in relation to what may be termed the canonical situation of utterance : this involves one - one, or one - many, signalling in the phonic medium along the vocal - auditory channel, with all the participants present in the same actual situation able to see one another and to perceive the associated non - vocal paralinguistic features of their utterances, and each assuming the role of sender and receiver in turn There is much in the structure of languages that can only be explained on the assumption that they have developed for communication in face - to - face interaction.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	face to face	figurative	dashes	ADV ADV VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADP PUNCT NOUN ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ DET NOUN VERB NOUN CCONJ ADP PROPN PUNCT NOUN PUNCT NUM SYM NUM PUNCT VERB VERB PRON ADV ADV ADV PUNCT DET NOUN CCONJ NOUN ADP NOUN VERB ADV VERB ADP NOUN ADP NOUN VERB VERB VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT DET VERB NUM PUNCT NUM CCONJ NUM PUNCT ADJ VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET ADJ PUNCT ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ DET NOUN ADJ ADP DET ADJ ADJ NOUN ADJ PART VERB NUM DET CCONJ PART VERB DET ADJ ADJ PUNCT ADJ NOUN NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN CCONJ DET VERB DET NOUN ADP NOUN CCONJ NOUN ADP NOUN ADV VERB ADJ ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN ADJ VERB ADV VERB VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP PRON VERB VERB ADP NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT ADP PUNCT NOUN NOUN
