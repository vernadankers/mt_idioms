Though this neatly solves the problem of how man can make history while at the same time history makes him, it does not answer the larger question of how a multiplicity of the products of individual acts, ‘ totalizations’, can themselves be totalized into the overall totalization required by the logic of dialectical rationality — rather than being the arbitrary, blind and self - cancelling movements of, say, Hardy's immanent will.	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	make history	figurative	identical	ADP DET ADV VERB DET NOUN ADP ADV NOUN VERB VERB NOUN ADP ADP DET ADJ NOUN NOUN VERB PRON PRON VERB ADV VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP ADV DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT NOUN VERB PRON VERB VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN VERB ADP DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADV ADP VERB DET ADJ ADJ CCONJ NOUN PUNCT VERB NOUN ADP VERB PROPN ADJ NOUN
