It is therefore, Sartre argues, our historical task to make it known, promoting not just the historical process as such, but also the general recognition whereby the plurality of the meanings of individual histories can be seen to combine to make one history, with one meaning — the ' Truth of humanity'(I, 822 ).	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	make history	literal	insertion-other	PRON VERB ADV PROPN VERB ADJ ADJ NOUN PART VERB PRON VERB VERB ADV ADV DET ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ CCONJ ADV DET ADJ NOUN ADV DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN VERB VERB VERB PART VERB PART VERB NUM NOUN ADP NUM NOUN PUNCT DET PUNCT PROPN ADP PROPN NUM PUNCT	▁It ▁is ▁therefore , ▁Sar tre ▁argues , ▁our ▁historical ▁task ▁to ▁make ▁it ▁known , ▁promoting ▁not ▁just ▁the ▁historical ▁process ▁as ▁such , ▁but ▁also ▁the ▁general ▁recognition ▁whereby ▁the ▁p l ural ity ▁of ▁the ▁meaning s ▁of ▁individual ▁his to ries ▁can ▁be ▁seen ▁to ▁combine ▁to ▁make ▁one ▁history , ▁with ▁one ▁meaning ▁ — ▁the ▁' ▁Tru th ▁of ▁humanity ' ( I , ▁82 2 ▁ ).	0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0	PRON VERB ADV ADV PROPN PROPN VERB VERB ADJ ADJ NOUN PART VERB PRON VERB VERB VERB ADV ADV DET ADJ NOUN ADP ADJ ADJ CCONJ ADV DET ADJ NOUN ADV DET NOUN NOUN NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN NOUN NOUN VERB VERB VERB PART VERB PART VERB NUM NOUN NOUN ADP NUM NOUN PUNCT PUNCT DET PUNCT PROPN PROPN ADP PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN PROPN NUM NUM PUNCT PUNCT
