Right, I 've just got a, two or three minutes, I 've just wanna get something quickly done before we, we close and I 'm not gon na look up all the references, because your get them for next week any way in, in the house group, but, now, now in a sense it's difficult to understand to take all this in after all his God and were people, how do we understand Jesus, it's, it's difficult, however knowing something about them does help us to understand something important, it helps us to understand what happened when Jesus ascended, when he went back to heaven, you see when Jesus arose from the earth the, the disciples who watch him it says there in Acts chapter one, they saw him go up in to the heaven, up into you know in a cloud, have you ever thought what that really means what on earth was it, they saw him go up in a cloud, can you image a sort of great clouds coming and dropping down over the mountain top there and was suddenly whisking Jesus up and then watching Jesus going up in this cloud into the sky, I don't really think it was quite like that, have you ever wonder why it was that Jesus went up in a cloud, you see what was he doing, he wasn't beginning a journey to some far off place in the universe, some distant corner where God the father was, he wasn't doing that at all, what do you think a cloud can you, give any suggestions of what a cloud might represent because very often a lot of some of the language in the bible is picture language and it, it, it speaks as something else, what do, what do you think a cloud, does any body have suggestions of what a
