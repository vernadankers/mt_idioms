consideration ) of this lease ( iii ) in the case of property falling within paragraph ( 4 ) below on the terms ( other than as to rent or other pecuniary consideration ) upon which it was last

determined will be revised every five years ( b ) " qualified accountant " means a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales or the Association of Certified Accountants ( 2 ) If the tenant lets or permits to be occupied the whole or any part of the demised property in return for any pecuniary consideration other than the full rack rental value thereof as at the date of

as at the date of such letting or permission and redetermined as at every fifth anniversary thereof ( 3 ) If the tenant himself occupies the whole or any part of the demised property then he shall be deemed for the purposes of this schedule to be entitled to receive the full rack rental value thereof determined as at the date on which he went into occupation and redetermined as at every fifth anniversary thereof ( 4 ) If the whole or any part of the demised property remains vacant for three months or more then at the expiry of such period of three months the tenant shall until the same is
